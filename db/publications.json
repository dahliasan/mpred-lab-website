This is particularly true in the Southern Ocean, where mesopelagic fishes are both key predators and prey, but where the remote environment makes sampling challenging. Despite this, multiple national Antarctic research programs have undertaken regional sampling of mesopelagic fish over several decades. However, data are dispersed, and sampling methodologies often differ precluding comparisons and limiting synthetic analyses. We identified potential data holders by compiling a metadata catalogue of existing survey data for Southern Ocean mesopelagic fishes. Data holders contributed 17,491 occurrence and 11,190 abundance records from 4780 net hauls from 72 different research cruises. Data span across 37 years from 1991 to 2019 and include trait-based information (length, weight, maturity). The final dataset underwent quality control processes and detailed metadata was provided for each sampling event. This dataset can be accessed through Zenodo. <jats:italic>Myctobase<\/jats:italic> will enhance research capacity by providing the broadscale baseline data necessary for observing and modelling mesopelagic fishes.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Cephalopods are an important component of Southern Ocean food webs, but aspects of their trophic ecology remain unresolved. Here, we used archived squid (order Teuthida) beaks, collected from stomach contents of predators at Macquarie and Kerguelen Islands, to investigate the trophic structure within an assemblage of pelagic squids (<jats:italic>Alluroteuthis antarcticus, Filippovia knipovitchi, Gonatus antarcticus, Histioteuthis eltaninae, Martialia hyadesi<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Brachioteuthis linkovskyi<\/jats:italic>). We combined bulk nitrogen stable isotopes (δ<jats:sup>15<\/jats:sup>N<jats:sub>bulk<\/jats:sub>) with compound-specific isotope analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AA) to estimate the trophic position (TP) of species and to assess isotopic relationships with body size at the species, community, and ocean basin levels. We observed significantly higher mean δ<jats:sup>15<\/jats:sup>N<jats:sub>bulk<\/jats:sub> values for species at the Kerguelen Islands compared to conspecifics at Macquarie Island. This result was explained by regional variability in δ<jats:sup>15<\/jats:sup>N values of phenylalanine (δ<jats:sup>15<\/jats:sup>N<jats:sub>Phe<\/jats:sub>), suggesting that predator species were accessing different isotopic baselines at each region. This may highlight the different foraging strategies of both species. The overlap in species TP estimates from CSIA-AA (TP<jats:sub>CSIA<\/jats:sub>) between the 2 communities (Macquarie Island TP<jats:sub>CSIA<\/jats:sub> min: 2.3, max: 5.3; Kerguelen Islands TP<jats:sub>CSIA<\/jats:sub> min: 2.7, max: 5.3) indicated a similar trophic structure at both locations. We note unrealistically low TP<jats:sub>CSIA<\/jats:sub> for some species, which we attribute to uncertainty of trophic discrimination factors. TP estimates suggested that squid encompass 3 trophic levels from mid-trophic levels to higher predators. We did not find strong or consistent relationships between TP and body size at either the species- or community-level. One of the largest squid species, <jats:italic>M. hyadesi,<\/jats:italic> occupied the lowest TP in both communities. These new insights into the trophic structure of the Southern Ocean squid community have important implications for the future representation of pelagic squids in ecosystem models.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Southern Ocean ecosystems are globally important and vulnerable to global drivers of change, yet they remain challenging to study. Fish and squid make up a significant portion of the biomass within the Southern Ocean, filling key roles in food webs from forage to mid-trophic species and top predators. They comprise a diverse array of species uniquely adapted to the extreme habitats of the region. Adaptations such as antifreeze glycoproteins, lipid-retention, extended larval phases, delayed senescence, and energy-conserving life strategies equip Antarctic fish and squid to withstand the dark winters and yearlong subzero temperatures experienced in much of the Southern Ocean. In addition to krill exploitation, the comparatively high commercial value of Antarctic fish, particularly the lucrative toothfish, drives fisheries interests, which has included illegal fishing. Uncertainty about the population dynamics of target species and ecosystem structure and function more broadly has necessitated a precautionary, ecosystem approach to managing these stocks and enabling the recovery of depleted species. Fisheries currently remain the major local driver of change in Southern Ocean fish productivity, but global climate change presents an even greater challenge to assessing future changes. Parts of the Southern Ocean are experiencing ocean-warming, such as the West Antarctic Peninsula, while other areas, such as the Ross Sea shelf, have undergone cooling in recent years. These trends are expected to result in a redistribution of species based on their tolerances to different temperature regimes. Climate variability may impair the migratory response of these species to environmental change, while imposing increased pressures on recruitment. Fisheries and climate change, coupled with related local and global drivers such as pollution and sea ice change, have the potential to produce synergistic impacts that compound the risks to Antarctic fish and squid species. The uncertainty surrounding how different species will respond to these challenges, given their varying life histories, environmental dependencies, and resiliencies, necessitates regular assessment to inform conservation and management decisions. Urgent attention is needed to determine whether the current management strategies are suitably precautionary to achieve conservation objectives in light of the impending changes to the ecosystem.<\/jats:p>",

In southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>), however, offspring receive no knowledge from their parents, only fat reserves. This research focuses on how dispersal direction on their maiden foraging trip and physical traits influence the survival of naïve southern elephant seal pups at Macquarie Island. We tracked 44 pups with satellite tags during their post-weaning migration and compared their movements to the post-moult winter migrations of 58 adult females. We found that most pups (61.2%) travelled southeast, in line with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Pups travelling with the predominant east-southeast current had a 1.5 times higher survival rate for their first trip than those swimming westward against it. Those that swam with the current and were heavier were more likely to survive their first year. Adult females showed different dispersal patterns, where they travelled southwards towards Antarctic waters, implying that learning from experience influences their direction. Future investigations into the role of the primary eastward current in the sub-Antarctic on circumpolar movement patterns of top marine predators could expand our understanding of Southern Ocean ecology.<\/jats:p>",

However, large areas of the East Antarctic continental shelf remain poorly observed, making it challenging to determine if the supply of oceanic heat to the ice shelves is changing. Here, we use temperature and salinity profiles to the west of the Shackleton Ice Shelf (SIS; ≈100°E) spanning 60 years to assess the variability of the water masses in the context of a changing climate. We document warming and freshening of shelf waters. Prior to 1996, cold mCDW water (<jats:italic>θ<\/jats:italic> &lt; −1.6°C) was found below the surface mixed layer and cold Dense Shelf Water (DSW) with a salinity of &gt;34.5 dominated the water column. After 2010, warm mCDW (≥−1.0°C) was widespread over the continental shelf and DSW with salinity over 34.5 was no longer present. The mixing ratio of glacial meltwater indicates that warm mCDW observed in 2011 caused basal melting of the SIS, possibly reducing the salinity of DSW. Increased access of warm waters to the continental shelf may have also occurred on the eastern side of the ice shelf, where glaciological evidence shows the grounding line has retreated. These observations suggest a shift occurred prior to 2011 that has increased the ocean heat supply to the continental shelf and to the SIS, increasing basal melt and reducing DSW formation.<\/jats:p>",

Continental shelf bathymetry influences warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water movement onto the shelf, making it an important factor promoting ice shelf melting and influencing the flow of ice shelves into the ocean. Building on previous work using seal dives to redefine bathymetry, our longitudinal study of ocean physics and animal behaviour provided new depth information from over 500,000 individual seal dives on the East Antarctic continental shelf. About 25% of these seal dives were 220 m (sometimes over 1000 m) deeper than the interpolated seafloor from IBCSO V2. Focusing on four well-sampled regions, we show that the bathymetry of 22% to 60% of the sampled area was improved by incorporating seal dive data. This revealed new bathymetric features, including troughs off the Shackleton Ice Shelf and Underwood Glacier and a deep canyon near the Vanderford Glacier. This deep canyon, the <jats:italic>Mirounga-Nuyina Canyon<\/jats:italic>, was confirmed by a recent multi-beam echo sounder survey. Further acquisitions of seal data will improve our understanding and modelling of Antarctic coastal ocean processes and ice-sheet dynamics.<\/jats:p>",

Southern elephant seals (\n            <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>\n            ) are highly dimorphic and extremely polygynous marine mammals. A demographic model, supported by long-term capture–mark–recapture records, investigated the influence of sex and age on survival in this species. The study revealed clear differences between female and male age-dependent survival rates. Overall juvenile survival estimates were stable around 80–85% for both sexes. However, male survival estimates were 5–10% lower than females in the same age classes until 8 years of age. At this point, male survival decreased rapidly to 50% ± 10% while female estimates remained constant at 80% ± 5%. Different energetic requirements could underpin intersex differences in adult survival. However, the species' strong sexual dimorphism diverges during early juvenile development when sex-specific survival rates were less distinct. Maximizing growth is especially advantageous for males, with size being a major determinant of breeding probability. Maturing males may employ a high-risk high-reward foraging strategy to compensate for extensive sexual selection pressures and sex-specific energetic needs. Our findings suggest sex-specific adult survival is a result of\n            <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic>\n            ecological interactions and evolutionary specialization associated with being a highly polygynous marine predator.\n          <\/jats:p>",

However, not all polynyas form DSW. We examine how the physiographic setting, water‐mass distribution and transformation, water column stratification, and sea‐ice production regulate DSW formation in four East Antarctic coastal polynyas. We use a salt budget to estimate the relative contribution of sea‐ice production and lateral advection to the monthly change in salinity in each polynya. DSW forms in Mackenzie polynya due to a combination of physical features (shallow water depth and a broad continental shelf) and high sea‐ice production. Sea‐ice formation begins early (March) in Mackenzie polynya, counteracting fresh advection and establishing a salty mixed layer in autumn that preconditions the water column for deep convection in winter. Sea‐ice production is moderate in the other three polynyas, but saline DSW is not formed (a fresh variety is formed in the Barrier polynya). In the Shackleton polynya, brine rejection during winter is insufficient to overcome the very fresh autumn mixed layer. In Vincennes Bay, a strong inflow of modified Circumpolar Deep Water stratifies the water column, hindering deep convection and DSW formation. Our study highlights that DSW formation in a given polynya depends on a complex combination of factors, some of which may be strongly altered under a changing climate, with potentially important consequences for the ventilation of the deep ocean, the global meridional overturning circulation, and the transport of ocean heat to Antarctic ice shelves.<\/jats:p>",

Davis Base, Antarctica, acts as a moulting site for southern elephant seals that forage in Prydz Bay, but the mitochondrial haplotype diversity and natal source populations of these seals have not been characterized. In this study, we combined genetic and animal tracking data on these moulting seals to identify levels of mitochondrial haplotype diversity, natal source population, and movement behaviours during foraging and haul-out periods. Using partial sequences of the mitochondrial control region, we identified two major breeding mitochondrial lineages of seals at Davis Base. We found that the majority of the seals originated from breeding stocks within the South Atlantic Ocean and South Indian Ocean. One seal was grouped with the Macquarie Island breeding stock (South Pacific Ocean). The Macquarie Island population, unlike the other two stocks, is decreasing in size. Tracking data revealed long-distance foraging activity of the Macquarie Island seal around Crozet Islands. We speculate that changes to the Antarctic marine environment can result in a shift in foraging and movement strategies, which subsequently affects seal population growth rates. <\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Antarctic polynyas are persistent open water areas which enable early and large seasonal phytoplankton blooms. This high primary productivity, boosted by iron supply from coastal glaciers, attracts organisms from all trophic levels to form a rich and diverse community. How the ecological benefit of polynya productivity is translated to the highest trophic levels remains poorly resolved. We studied 119 southern elephant seals feeding over the Antarctic shelf and demonstrated that: (i) 96% of seals foraging here used polynyas, with individuals spending on average 62% of their time there; (ii) the seals exhibited more area-restricted search behaviour when in polynyas; and (iii) these seals gained more energy (indicated by increased buoyancy from greater fat stores) when inside polynyas. This higher-quality foraging existed even when ice was not present in the study area, indicating that these are important and predictable foraging grounds year-round. Despite these energetic advantages from using polynyas, not all the seals used them extensively. Factors other than food supply may influence an individual's choice in their use of feeding grounds, such as exposure to predation or the probability of being able to return to distant sub-Antarctic breeding sites.<\/jats:p>",

Differences in habitat selection among individuals may arise from several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and yet, their interaction has been given little attention in the study of wild populations. We combine sex, body size, and boldness to explain individual differences in the seasonal foraging habitat selection of southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) from the Kerguelen Archipelago. We hypothesize that habitat selection is linked to the trade‐off between resource acquisition and risk, and that individuals differ in their position along this trade‐off because of differences in reproductive strategies, life stages, and metabolic requirements. Before the post‐molt foraging trip, we used a novel object approach test to quantify the boldness of 28 subadult and adult females and 42 subadult males and equipped them with data loggers to track their movements at sea. Subadult males selected neritic and oceanic habitats, whereas females mostly selected less productive oceanic habitats. Both sexes showed a seasonal shift from Antarctic habitats in the south in the summer to the free of ice subantarctic and subtropical habitats in the north in the winter. Males avoided oceanic habitats and selected more productive neritic and Antarctic habitats with body size mostly in the winter. Bolder males selected northern warmer waters in winter, while shyer ones selected the Kerguelen plateau and southern colder oceanic waters. Bolder females selected the Kerguelen plateau in the summer when prey profitability is assumed to be the highest. This study not only provides new insights into the spatiotemporal foraging ecology of elephant seals in relation to personality but also emphasizes the relevance of combining several intrinsic and extrinsic factors in understanding among‐individual variation in space use essential in wildlife management and conservation.<\/jats:p>",

Dense Shelf Water (DSW) formation in MP shows large spatial variability that is related to the (a) local bathymetry, (b) water column preconditioning from the presence/absence of different water masses, and (c) proximity to the Amery Ice Shelf meltwater outflow. MP exhibits sustained sea ice production and brine rejection (thus, salinity increase) from April to October. However, new DSW is only formed from June onward, when the mixed layer deepens and convection is strong enough to break the stratification set by Antarctic Surface Water above and Ice Shelf Water below. We found no evidence of DSW export from MP to Darnley polynya, as previously suggested. Rather, our observations suggest some DSW formed in Darnley Polynya may drain toward the western Prydz Bay. Then, DSW is exported offshore from Prydz Bay through the Prydz Channel. The interplay between sea ice formation, meltwater input, and sea floor topography is likely to explain why some coastal polynyas form more DSW than others, as well as the temporal variability in DSW formation within a particular polynya.<\/jats:p>",

Davis Base, Antarctica, acts as a moulting site for southern elephant seals that forage in Prydz Bay, but the genetic diversity and natal source populations of these seals has not been characterized. Determining the genetic diversity of moulting populations like this one provides essential information on seal dispersal, inter-population mixing, and foraging behaviours. In this study, we combined genetic and animal tracking data on these moulting seals to identify levels of genetic diversity, natal source population, and movement behaviours during foraging and haul-out periods. Using mitochondrial sequence data, we identified two major breeding lineages of seals at Davis Base. We found that the majority of the seals originated from breeding stocks within the South Atlantic Ocean and South Indian Ocean. One seal was grouped with the Macquarie Island breeding stock (South Pacific Ocean). The Macquarie Island population, unlike the other two stocks, is decreasing in size. Tracking data revealed long-distance foraging activity of the Macquarie Island seal around Crozet Islands. We speculate that changes to the Antarctic marine environment have resulted in a shift in foraging and dispersal strategies, which subsequently affects seal population growth rates. These findings have implications for conservation management plans aimed at improving the population status of the southern elephant seal.<\/jats:p>",

Changes in the demography of predator populations are indicators of broader shifts in food web structure, but long‐term data are required to study these effects. Southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) from Macquarie Island have consistently decreased in population size while all other major populations across the Southern Ocean have recently stabilized or are increasing. Two long‐term mark‐recapture studies (1956–1967 and 1993–2009) have monitored this population, which provides an opportunity to investigate demographic performance over a range of climatic conditions. Using a 9‐state matrix population model, we estimated climate influences on female survival by incorporating two major climatic indices into our model: The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Our best model included a 1 year lagged effect of SAM and an unlagged SOI as covariates. A positive relationship with SAM1 (lagged) related the previous year's SAM with juvenile survival, potentially due to changes in local prey availability surrounding Macquarie Island. The unlagged SOI had a negative effect on both juvenile and adult seals, indicating that sea ice dynamics and access to foraging grounds on the East Antarctic continental shelf could explain the different contributions of ENSO events on the survival of females in this population.<\/jats:p>",

While the Weddell and Ross Seas are recognized as key sites for AABW production, additional sources have been discovered in coastal polynya regions around East Antarctica, most recently at Vincennes Bay. Vincennes Bay, despite encompassing two distinct polynya regions, is considered the weakest source, producing Dense Shelf Water (DSW) only just dense enough to contribute to the lighter density classes of AABW found offshore. Here we provide the first detailed oceanographic observations of the continental shelf in Vincennes Bay (104‐111°E), using CTD data from instrumented elephant seals spanning from February to November of 2012. We find that Vincennes Bay has East Antarctica’s warmest recorded intrusions of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) and that warm mCDW drives basal melt under Vanderford and Underwood ice shelves. Our study also provides the first direct observational evidence for the inflow of meltwater to this region, which increases stratification and hinders DSW formation, and thus AABW production. The Vincennes Bay glaciers, together with the Totten Glacier, drain part of the Aurora Basin, which holds up to 7 m of sea level rise equivalent. Our results highlight the vulnerability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to intrusions of mCDW.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Partitioning resources is a key mechanism for avoiding intraspecific competition and maximizing individual energy gain. However, in sexually dimorphic species it is difficult to discern if partitioning is due to competition or the different resource needs of morphologically distinct individuals. In the highly dimorphic southern elephant seal, there are intersexual differences in habitat use; at Iles Kerguelen, males predominantly use shelf waters, while females use deeper oceanic waters. There are equally marked intrasexual differences, with some males using the nearby Kerguelen Plateau, and others using the much more distant Antarctic continental shelf (~2,000 km away). We used this combination of inter and intrasexual behavior to test two hypotheses regarding habitat partitioning in highly dimorphic species. (a) that intersexual differences in habitat use will not appear until the seals diverge in body size and (b) that some habitats have higher rates of energy return than others. In particular, that the Antarctic shelf would provide higher energy returns than the Kerguelen Shelf, to offset the greater cost of travel. We quantified the habitat use of 187 southern elephant seals (102 adult females and 85 subadult males). The seals in the two groups were the same size (~2.4 m) removing the confounding effect of body size. We found that the intersexual differences in habitat use existed before the divergence in body size. Also, we found that the amount of energy gained was the same in all of the major habitats. This suggests that the use of shelf habitats by males is innate, and a trade‐off between the need to access the large benthic prey available on shelf waters, against the higher risk of predation there. Intrasexual differences in habitat use are another trade‐off; although there are fewer predators on the Antarctic shelf, it is subject to considerable interannual fluctuations in sea‐ice extent. In contrast, the Kerguelen Plateau presents more consistent foraging opportunities, but contains higher levels of predation. Habitat partitioning in this highly dimorphic species is therefore the result of complex interplay of life history strategies, environmental conditions and predation pressure.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Biophysical interactions are influential in determining the scale of key ecological processes within marine ecosystems. For oceanic predators, this means foraging behaviour is influenced by processes shaping the distribution of prey. However, oceanic prey is difficult to observe and its abundance and distribution is regionally generalised. We use a spatiotemporally resolved simulation model to describe mid‐trophic prey distribution within the Southern Ocean and demonstrate insights that this modelled prey field provides into the foraging behaviour of a widely distributed marine predator, the southern elephant seal.<\/jats:p><jats:p>From a five‐year simulation of prey biomass, we computed climatologies of mean prey biomass (average prey conditions) and prey biomass variability (meso‐scale variability). We also compiled spatially gridded metrics of seal density and diving behaviour from 13 yr of tracking data. We statistically modelled these metrics as non‐linear functions of prey biomass (both mean and variability) and used these to predict seal distribution and behaviour. Our predictions were consistent with observations (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>adj<\/jats:sub> = 0.23), indicating that seals aggregate in regions of high mesoscale activity where eddies concentrate prey. Here, seals dived deeper (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.12, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.51) and spent less time hunting (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.05, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.56), likely targeting deep but profitable prey patches. Seals generally avoided areas of low eddy activity where prey was likely dispersed. Most seals foraged south of the Subantarctic Front, despite north of the front exhibiting consistently high simulated prey biomasses. This likely reflects seal prey or habitat preferences, but also emphasises the importance of mesoscale prey biomass variability relative to regionally high mean biomass. This work demonstrates the value of coupling mechanistic representations of prey biomass with predator observations to provide insight into how biophysical processes combine to shape species distributions. This will be increasingly important for the robust prediction of species’ responses to rapid system change.<\/jats:p>",

Using 20 years of mark-recapture data from three sympatric species of albatrosses (black-browed<jats:italic>Thalassarche melanophris<\/jats:italic>, grey-headed<jats:italic>T. chrysostoma<\/jats:italic>, and light-mantled albatrosses<jats:italic>Phoebetria palpebrata<\/jats:italic>), we quantified the influence of invasive European rabbits<jats:italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus<\/jats:italic>and extreme weather patterns on breeding probability and success. Temporal variability in rabbit density explained 33–76% of the variability in breeding probability for all three species, with severe decreases in breeding probability observed after a lag period following highest rabbit numbers. For black-browed albatrosses, the combination of extreme rainfall and high rabbit density explained 33% of total trait variability and dramatically reduced breeding success. We showed that invasive rabbits and extreme weather events reduce reproductive output in albatrosses and that eliminating rabbits had a positive effect on albatross reproduction. This illustrates how active animal management at a local breeding site can result in positive population outcomes even for wide ranging animals like albatrosses where influencing vital rates during their at-sea migrations is more challenging.<\/jats:p>",

Their spatio-temporal distribution is however, difficult to map across remote regions particularly the vast Southern Ocean. This represents a key gap in understanding biogeochemical processes, marine ecosystem structure, and how changing ocean conditions will affect marine predators, which depend upon mesopelagic prey. We infer mesopelagic prey vertical distribution and relative abundance in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (20° to 130°E) with a novel approach using predator-derived indices. Fourteen years of southern elephant seal tracking and dive data, from the open ocean between the Antarctic Polar Front and the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front, clearly show that the vertical distribution of mesopelagic prey is influenced by the physical hydrographic processes that structure their habitat. Mesopelagic prey have a more restricted vertical migration and higher relative abundance closer to the surface where Circumpolar Deep Water rises to shallower depths. Combining these observations with a future projection of Southern Ocean conditions we show that changes in the coupling of surface and deep waters will potentially redistribute mesopelagic prey. These changes are small overall, but show important spatial variability: prey will increase in relative abundance to the east of the Kerguelen Plateau but decrease to the west. The consequences for deep-diving specialists such as elephant seals and whales over this time scale will likely be minor, but the changes in mesoscale vertical energy flow have implications for predators that forage within the mesopelagic zone as well as the broader pelagic ecosystem.<\/jats:p>",

While traditional approaches to such analysis mostly focus on predicting animal states during movement, we describe an approach that allows us to identify representative movement patterns of different animal groups. To do this, we propose a carefully designed recurrent neural network and combine it with telemetry data for automatic feature extraction and identification of non-predefined representative patterns. In the experiment, we consider a particular marine predator species, the southern elephant seal, as an example. With our approach, we identify that the male seals in our data set share similar movement patterns when they are close to land. We identify this pattern recurring in a number of distant locations, consistent with alternative approaches from previous research.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Foraging behaviour of marine predators inferred from the analysis of horizontal or vertical movements commonly lack quantitative information about foraging success. Several marine mammal species are known to perform dives where they passively drift in the water column, termed “drift” dives. The drift rate is determined by the animal’s buoyancy, which can be used to make inference regarding body condition. Long term dive records retrieved via satellite uplink are often summarized before transmission. This loss of resolution hampers identification of drift dives. Here, we develop a flexible, hierarchically structured approach to identify drift dives and estimate the drift rate from the summarized time-depth profiles that are increasingly available to the global research community. Based on high-resolution dive data from southern elephant seals, we classify dives as drift/non-drift and apply a summarization algorithm. We then (i) automatically generate dive groups based on inflection point ordering using a ‘Reverse’ Broken-Stick Algorithm, (ii) develop a set of threshold criteria to apply across groups, ensuring non-drift dives are most efficiently rejected, and (iii) finally implement a custom Kalman filter to retain the remaining dives that are within the seals estimated drifting time series. Validation with independent data sets shows our method retains approximately 3% of all dives, of which 88% are true drift dives. The drift rate estimates are unbiased, with the upper 95% quantile of the mean squared error between the daily averaged summarized profiles using our method (SDDR) and the observed daily averaged drift rate (ODDR) being only 0.0015. The trend of the drifting time-series match expectations for capital breeders, showing the lowest body condition commencing foraging trips and a progressive improvement as they remain at sea. Our method offers sufficient resolution to track small changes in body condition at a fine temporal scale. This approach overcomes a long-term challenge for large existing and ongoing data collections, with potential application across other drift diving species. Enabling robust identification of foraging success at sea offers a rare and valuable opportunity for monitoring marine ecosystem productivity in space and time by tracking the success of a top predator.<\/jats:p>",

This method is applied on an ocean reanalysis data set and on in situ observations, revealing a seasonal variability of the PF latitudinal position that is most pronounced between the Conrad Rise and the Kerguelen Plateau. This shift coincides with variations in the transport across the Northern Kerguelen Plateau. We suggest that seasonal changes of the upper stratification may drive the observed variability of the PF, with potentially large implications for the pathways and residence time of water masses over the plateau and the phytoplankton bloom extending southeast of the Kerguelen Islands.<\/jats:p>",

We used analytical approaches, developed to cope with “big data”, that require no ‘<jats:italic>a priori’<\/jats:italic> assumptions about the behaviour of the target agents, to analyse a pooled tracking dataset of 272 elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) in the Southern Ocean, that was comprised of &gt;500,000 location estimates collected over more than a decade. Our analyses showed that the displacements of these seals were described by a truncated power law distribution across several spatial and temporal scales, with a clear signature of directed movement. This pattern was evident when analysing the aggregated tracks despite a wide diversity of individual trajectories. We also identified marine provinces that described the migratory and foraging habitats of these seals. Our analysis provides evidence for the presence of intrinsic drivers of movement, such as memory, that cannot be detected using common models of movement behaviour. These results highlight the potential for “big data” techniques to provide new insights into movement behaviour when applied to large datasets of animal tracking.<\/jats:p>",

Discriminant analysis achieved 80% successful identification, but machine‐learning models were better, achieving 100% successful identification, using six key measurements (fork length, caudal‐fin peduncle height, interdorsal space, second dorsal‐fin height, pelvic‐fin length and pelvic‐fin midpoint to first dorsal‐fin insertion). Furthermore, pelvic‐fin markings could be used for identification: <jats:italic>C. limbatus<\/jats:italic> has a distinct black mark &gt;3% of the total pelvic‐fin area, while <jats:italic>C. tilstoni<\/jats:italic> has markings with diffuse edges, or has smaller or no markings. Machine learning and pelvic‐fin marking identification methods were field tested achieving 87 and 90% successful identification, respectively. With further refinement, the techniques developed here will form an important part of a multi‐faceted approach to identification of <jats:italic>C. tilstoni<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>C. limbatus<\/jats:italic> and have a clear management and conservation application to these commercially important sharks. The methods developed here are broadly applicable and can be used to resolve species identities in many fisheries where cryptic species exist.<\/jats:p>",

However, how Weddell seals find food in the winter months remains poorly documented. We equipped adult Weddell seals after their annual molt with satellite‐relayed data loggers at two sites in East Antarctica: Dumont D'Urville (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 12, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DDU<\/jats:styled-content>) and Davis (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 20). We used binomial generalized mixed‐effect models to investigate Weddell seals’ behavioral response (i.e., “hunting” vs. “transit”) to physical aspects of their environment (e.g., ice concentration). Weddell seal foraging was concentrated to within 5 km of a breathing hole, and they appear to move between holes as local food is depleted. There were regional differences in behavior so that seals at Davis traveled greater distances (three times more) and spent less time in hunting mode (half the time) than seals at <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DDU<\/jats:styled-content>. Despite these differences, hunting dives at both locations were pelagic, concentrated in areas of high ice concentration, and over areas of complex bathymetry. There was also a seasonal change in diving behavior from transiting early in the season to more hunting during winter. Our observations suggest that Weddell seal foraging behavior is plastic and that they respond behaviorally to changes in their environment to maximize food acquisition and storage. Such plasticity is a hallmark of animals that live in very dynamic environments such as the high Antarctic where resources are unpredictable.<\/jats:p>",

We use species habitat models to predict the winter foraging habitats of female southern elephant seals and investigate how changes in environmental variables within these habitats may be related to observed decreases in the Macquarie Island population. There were three main groups of seals that specialized in different ocean realms (the sub‐Antarctic, the Ross Sea and the Victoria Land Coast). The physical and climate attributes (e.g. wind strength, sea surface height, ocean current strength) varied amongst the realms and also displayed different temporal trends over the last two to four decades. Most notably, sea ice extent increased on average in the Victoria Land realm while it decreased overall in the Ross Sea realm. Using a species distribution model relating mean residence times (time spent in each 50 × 50 km grid cell) to 9 climate and physical co‐variates, we developed spatial predictions of residence time to identify the core regions used by the seals across the Southern Ocean from 120°E to 120°W. Population size at Macquarie Island was negatively correlated with ice concentration within the core habitat of seals using the Victoria Land Coast and the Ross Sea. Sea ice extent and concentration is predicted to continue to change in the Southern Ocean, having unknown consequences for the biota of the region. The proportion of Macquarie Island females (40%) utilizing the relatively stable sub‐Antarctic region, may buffer this population against longer‐term regional changes in habitat quality, but the Macquarie Island population has persistently decreased (−1.45% per annum) over seven decades indicating that environmental changes in the Antarctic are acting on the remaining 60% of the population to impose a long‐term population decline in a top Southern Ocean predator.<\/jats:p>",

Using a unique set of historical whaling records from Western Australia (1952–1963), we investigated energy stores of large cetaceans with differing life histories, and quantified the relationship between total body lipid and length for humpback whales (<jats:italic>Megaptera novaeangliae)<\/jats:italic>(<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 905) and sperm whales<jats:italic>(Physeter macrocephalus)<\/jats:italic>(<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 1961). We found that total body lipid increased with body length in both humpback and sperm whales, consistent with size-related energy stores. Male humpback whales stored 2.49 kl (15.6 barrels) (31.9–74.9%) more lipid than male sperm whales of equivalent length, to fuel their annual migration. Relative lipid stores of sperm whales (males) were constant throughout the year, while those of humpback whales varied with reproductive class and sampling date. Pregnant female humpback whales had higher relative energy stores than non-pregnant females and males (26.2% and 37.4%, respectively), to fuel the energy demands of gestation and lactation. Those that reached the sampling site later (<jats:italic>en route<\/jats:italic>to their breeding grounds) carried higher lipid stores than those that arrived earlier, possibly reflecting individual variation in residency times in the Antarctic feeding grounds. Importantly, longer pregnant females had relatively larger energy stores than the shorter pregnant females, indicating that the smaller individuals may experience higher levels of energetic stress during the migration fast. The relationships we developed between body lipid and length can be used to inform bioenergetics and ecosystem models when such detailed information is not available.<\/jats:p>",

Quantifying how Antarctic predators respond to such changes provides the context for predicting how climate variability/change will affect these assemblages into the future. Over an 11-year time-series, we examine how inter-annual variability in sea ice concentration and advance affect the foraging behaviour of a top Antarctic predator, the southern elephant seal. Females foraged longer in pack ice in years with greatest sea ice concentration and earliest sea ice advance, while males foraged longer in polynyas in years of lowest sea ice concentration. There was a positive relationship between near-surface meridional wind anomalies and female foraging effort, but not for males. This study reveals the complexities of foraging responses to climate forcing by a poleward migratory predator through varying sea ice property and dynamic anomalies.<\/jats:p>",

Southern elephant seals in particular, can provide useful insights due to their circumpolar distribution, their long and distant migrations and their performance of extended bouts of deep diving. Furthermore, across their range, elephant seal populations have very different population trends. In this study, we present a data set from the International Polar Year project; Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole for southern elephant seals, in which a large number of instruments (<jats:italic>N<\/jats:italic> = 287) deployed on animals, encompassing a broad circum‐Antarctic geographic extent, collected <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic> ocean data and at‐sea foraging metrics that explicitly link foraging behavior and habitat structure in time and space. Broadly speaking, the seals foraged in two habitats, the relatively shallow waters of the Antarctic continental shelf and the Kerguelen Plateau and deep open water regions. Animals of both sexes were more likely to exhibit area‐restricted search (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ARS<\/jats:styled-content>) behavior rather than transit in shelf habitats. While Antarctic shelf waters can be regarded as prime habitat for both sexes, female seals tend to move northwards with the advance of sea ice in the late autumn or early winter. The water masses used by the seals also influenced their behavioral mode, with female <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ARS<\/jats:styled-content> behavior being most likely in modified Circumpolar Deepwater or northerly Modified Shelf Water, both of which tend to be associated with the outer reaches of the Antarctic Continental Shelf. The combined effects of (1) the differing habitat quality, (2) differing responses to encroaching ice as the winter progresses among colonies, (3) differing distances between breeding and haul‐out sites and high quality habitats, and (4) differing long‐term regional trends in sea ice extent can explain the differing population trends observed among elephant seal colonies.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite being critically endangered, the at-sea behaviour of hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) remains insufficiently understood to support a global conservation strategy. Habitat location and spatial use are poorly documented, which is particularly true for the globally important Australian hawksbill population. We equipped 10 adult female hawksbill turtles nesting on Groote Eylandt, northern Australia, with Fastloc GPS and Argos satellite transmitters. We quantified fine-scale habitat use and area-restricted search behaviour, and located potential feeding and developmental habitats by simulating hatchling turtle dispersal patterns by using a particle-tracking hydrological model. During the breeding season, females mostly remained near their nesting site. Post-breeding, all turtles migrated to foraging sites on the Australian continental shelf, primarily in the Gulf of Carpentaria in coastal seagrass pastures, but also offshore near coral-reef platforms. The distribution of adult foraging grounds was similar to simulated dispersal patterns of hatchling turtles from distant rookeries, thus highlighting the ecological significance of the Gulf of Carpentaria for hawksbill turtles. Although this hawksbill turtle population is likely to be endemic to Australian waters, national and international conservation initiatives are required to mitigate sources of anthropogenic mortality (e.g. illegal tortoise-shell trade, incidental captures in fishing gear, marine debris, seabed mining exploitation).<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\n\nContext\nFollowing centuries of intense human exploitation, the global stocks of hawksbill turtle have decreased precipitously and the species is currently considered Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Australia supports the largest breeding aggregations worldwide; however, there are no accurate estimates of population abundance and seasonality for hawksbill turtles at important nesting grounds in eastern Arnhem Land.\n\nAims\nThis study was designed to fill in this lack of ecological information and assist with the conservation and management of hawksbill turtles. More specifically, our overarching goals were to assess nesting seasonality, habitat preferences and provide the first estimate of annual nesting population size at a Northern Territory rookery.\n\nMethods\nIn 2009 and 2010 we collected beach monitoring, satellite telemetry and sand temperature data over two nesting seasons at a group of three islands located 30 km off Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. We subsequently analysed these data to unravel hawksbill nesting behaviour and reproductive outputs, and examined the vulnerability of this rookery to climate change.\n\nKey results\nHawksbill turtle nesting seasonality consistently started in mid-May, peaked in mid-August and ended in late November. Annual nesting abundance showed a near 3-fold increase between 2009 and 2010, with an average of 220 and 580 hawksbill females nesting on this island group respectively. Sand temperature at 50 cm reached more than 30°C at all monitored sites during most of the peak of the incubation period.\n\nConclusions\nThis remote and untouched group of islands constitutes a major hawksbill turtle rookery both nationally and globally. While anthropogenic impacts and predation are low year round, climate change threatens to skew hatchling sex ratios, eventually leading to an increase in hatchling mortality.\n\nImplications\nAdditional ground-based surveys are required to refine the accuracy of population estimates presented in this study. Given the paucity of data in the region, we recommend this island group off Groote Eylandt be used as a population-monitoring index site for the eastern Arnhem Land hawksbill turtle breeding aggregation.\n\n<\/jats:p>",

We show that all breeding colonies are genetically divergent and that connectivity in this highly mobile pinniped is not strongly associated with geographic distance, but more likely linked to Holocene climate change and demographic processes. Estimates of divergence times between populations were all after the last glacial maximum, and there was evidence for directional migration in a clockwise pattern (with the prevailing current) around the Antarctic. We discuss the mechanisms by which climate change may have contributed to the contemporary genetic structure of southern elephant seal populations and the broader implications.<\/jats:p>",

Here we show new observations from CTD-instrumented elephant seals in 2011–2013 that provide the first complete assessment of dense shelf water formation in Prydz Bay. After a complex evolution involving opposing contributions from three polynyas (positive) and two ice shelves (negative), dense shelf water (salinity 34.65–34.7) is exported through Prydz Channel. This provides a distinct, relatively fresh contribution to Cape Darnley bottom water. Elsewhere, dense water formation is hindered by the freshwater input from the Amery and West Ice Shelves into the Prydz Bay Gyre. This study highlights the susceptibility of Antarctic bottom water to increased freshwater input from the enhanced melting of ice shelves, and ultimately the potential collapse of Antarctic bottom water formation in a warming climate.<\/jats:p>",

This landmark dataset of around 75,000 temperature and salinity profiles from 20–140 °E, concentrated on the sector between the Kerguelen Islands and Prydz Bay, continues to grow through the coordinated efforts of French and Australian marine research teams. The seal data are quality controlled and calibrated using delayed-mode techniques involving comparisons with other existing profiles as well as cross-comparisons similar to established protocols within the Argo community, with a resulting accuracy of ±0.03 °C in temperature and ±0.05 in salinity or better. The data offer invaluable new insights into the water masses, oceanographic processes and provides a vital tool for oceanographers seeking to advance our understanding of this key component of the global ocean climate.<\/jats:p>",

The age at which individuals first reproduce is an important factor influencing the intensity of potential costs (e.g. reduced survival) involved in the first breeding event. However, quantifying age-related variation in the cost of first reproduction in wild animals remains challenging because of the difficulty in reliably recording the first breeding event. Here, using a multi-event capture–recapture model that accounts for both imperfect detection and uncertainty in the breeding status on an 18-year dataset involving 6637 individuals, we estimated age and state-specific survival of female elephant seals (\n            <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>\n            ) in the declining Macquarie Island population. We detected a clear cost of first reproduction on survival. This cost was higher for both younger first-time breeders and older first-time breeders compared with females recruiting at age four, the overall mean age at first reproduction. Neither earlier primiparity nor delaying primiparity appear to confer any evolutionary advantage, rather the optimal strategy seems to be to start breeding at a single age, 4 years.\n          <\/jats:p>",

Multiple species of native herbivores compete directly for resources with humans, such that wildlife populations are regularly managed to reduce their impact on agricultural and forestry landscapes. There is an increasing need to quantify the impacts of such wildlife management strategies on localised populations of Tasmania's iconic fauna. Gathering this information often requires capture and restraint of animals, but due to a paucity of published information on responses of wildlife to such techniques, regulatory bodies overseeing research do not always have complete information upon which to base decisions. In our study, the regulatory body designated manual restraint over chemical immobilisation as the preferred method, but current prescribed techniques can result in capture-related injuries including myopathy. To encourage dialogue on this welfare issue, we present observations on capture and restraint of the endemic Tasmanian pademelon <jats:italic>(Thylogale billardierii)<\/jats:italic>. Three of 19 animals that were trapped as part of a research study exhibited symptoms consistent with capture myopathy. Results suggest that techniques involved with capture and manual restraint can be problematic for pademelons, and we present recommendations for preventative measures, including chemical immobilisation, to limit myopathy-related deaths.<\/jats:p>",

A calibrated collection of seal‐derived hydrographic data is now available, consisting of more than 165,000 profiles. The value of these hydrographic data within the existing Southern Ocean observing system is demonstrated herein by conducting two state estimation experiments, differing only in the use or not of seal data to constrain the system. Including seal‐derived data substantially modifies the estimated surface mixed‐layer properties and circulation patterns within and south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Agreement with independent satellite observations of sea ice concentration is improved, especially along the East Antarctic shelf. Instrumented animals efficiently reduce a critical observational gap, and their contribution to monitoring polar climate variability will continue to grow as data accuracy and spatial coverage increase.<\/jats:p>",

An understanding of how body condition changes at fine spatial and temporal scales as a result of interaction with the environment provides necessary information about how animals acquire resources.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>However, comparatively little is known about intra‐ and interindividual variation of condition in marine systems. Where condition has been studied, changes typically are recorded at relatively coarse time‐scales. By quantifying how fine‐scale interaction with the environment influences condition, we can broaden our understanding of how animals acquire resources and allocate them to body stores.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here we used a hierarchical Bayesian state‐space model to estimate the body condition as measured by the size of an animal's lipid store in two closely related species of marine predator that occupy different hemispheres: northern elephant seals (<jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">M<\/jats:styled-content>irounga angustirostris<\/jats:italic>) and southern elephant seals (<jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">M<\/jats:styled-content>irounga leonina<\/jats:italic>). The observation model linked drift dives to lipid stores. The process model quantified daily changes in lipid stores as a function of the physiological condition of the seal (lipid:lean tissue ratio, departure lipid and departure mass), its foraging location, two measures of behaviour and environmental covariates.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that physiological condition significantly impacted lipid gain at two time‐scales – daily and at departure from the colony – that foraging location was significantly associated with lipid gain in both species of elephant seals and that long‐term behavioural phase was associated with positive lipid gain in northern and southern elephant seals. In northern elephant seals, the occurrence of short‐term behavioural states assumed to represent foraging were correlated with lipid gain. Lipid gain was a function of covariates in both species. Southern elephant seals performed fewer drift dives than northern elephant seals and gained lipids at a lower rate.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We have demonstrated a new way to obtain time series of body condition estimates for a marine predator at fine spatial and temporal scales. This modelling approach accounts for uncertainty at many levels and has the potential to integrate physiological and movement ecology of top predators. The observation model we used was specific to elephant seals, but the process model can readily be applied to other species, providing an opportunity to understand how animals respond to their environment at a fine spatial scale.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<\/jats:list>\n<\/jats:p>",

An essential step in managing large ‘feral’ animal populations is to quantify how they use habitats so that management interventions, such as culling, can be targeted to reduce densities and to minimize migration into areas from which animals have been removed. An effective method to quantify animal movements is by measuring landscape‐scale genetic population structure. We describe the genetic population structure of one of Australia's more destructive introduced mammals – the Asian swamp buffalo (<jats:italic>Bubalus bubalis<\/jats:italic>). We collected 524 skin samples from buffalo across their range in the Northern Territory of Australia. Allelic diversity in the Northern Territory population was low compared to those reported from populations in their native Asian habitats. The Australian population is tentatively made of three subpopulations; Melville Island, Eastern Arnhem and Central‐Western Arnhem populations. The Melville Island population is represented by a single cluster, while the Eastern Arnhem population has three clusters and the Central‐Western Arnhem population seven clusters. We found some support for isolation by distance across all the sampled populations, but little evidence for this relationship when comparing the two well‐mixed mainland meta‐populations. Despite their small founder populations and limited genetic variation, the persistence of buffalo in Australia has likely been aided by release from high predation, parasitism and disease typical of their native habitats.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\n\nContext\nSpread of the invasive cane toad (Rhinella marina) across northern Australia is of concern. Predator species, including the freshwater crocodile (Crocodylus johnstoni), are susceptible to cane toad toxins when ingested. Upstream populations of freshwater crocodiles are smaller than downstream counterparts because of limited resources. We measured the impact of cane toad arrival on densities of these upstream populations.\n\nAims\nOur aim was to determine whether the influx of cane toads had a negative impact on populations of upstream ‘stunted’ freshwater crocodiles.\n\nMethods\nPopulation surveys for crocodiles were conducted in three upstream creek systems, using day- and night-based survey methods, before the arrival of cane toads in the area. These surveys were repeated under similar conditions following the arrival of cane toads, to compare the distribution and densities of freshwater crocodiles and, hence, measure the impact of cane toads.\n\nKey results\nThere were significant declines in crocodile density at two survey sites following the arrival of cane toads, and we found dead crocodiles and cane toad carcasses with crocodile bite marks. The third site showed no change in density. There was a decline in mean density across all sites from 3.0 crocodiles km–1 to 1.1 crocodiles km–1 following the arrival of cane toads.\n\nConclusions\nThere was an overall decrease in crocodile densities and a reduction in distribution following the arrival of cane toads into the survey area. Dead crocodiles and evidence of their having eaten cane toads strongly suggest that these declines were caused directly by the arrival of cane toads into the area. One site showed no apparent change other than an increase in wariness, which may reflect the distribution of available feeding and shelter resources among the three sites.\n\nImplications\nThese results suggest that upstream freshwater crocodile populations are highly susceptible to cane toad toxins, and that impacts on their population can include local extirpation. Considering their morphological and possibly genetic distinctiveness, the loss of these unique populations is of conservation concern.\n\n<\/jats:p>",

In particular, determining with certainty when an individual breeds for the first time is not always obvious. This can be problematic because uncertainty about the transition from a prebreeder to a breeder state – recruitment – leads to uncertainty in vital rate estimates and in turn in population projection models. To avoid this issue, the common practice is to discard imperfect data from the analyses. However, this practice can generate a bias in vital rate estimates if uncertainty is related to a specific component of the population and reduces the sample size of the dataset and consequently the statistical power to detect effects of biological interest. Here, we compared the demographic parameters assessed from a standard multistate capture–recapture approach to the estimates obtained from the newly developed multi‐event framework that specifically accounts for uncertainty in state assessment. Using a comprehensive longitudinal dataset on southern elephant seals, we demonstrated that the multi‐event model enabled us to use all the data collected (6639 capture–recapture histories vs. 4179 with the multistate model) by accounting for uncertainty in breeding states, thereby increasing the precision and accuracy of the demographic parameter estimates. The multi‐event model allowed us to incorporate imperfect data into demographic analyses. The gain in precision obtained has important implications in the conservation and management of species because limiting uncertainty around vital rates will permit predicting population viability with greater accuracy.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nGlobal Positioning System (GPS) wildlife telemetry collars are being used increasingly to understand the movement patterns of wild mammals. However, there are few published studies on which to gauge their general utility and success. This paper highlights issues faced by some of the first researchers to use GPS technology for terrestrial mammal tracking in Australia. Our collated data cover 24 studies where GPS collars were used in 280 deployments on 13 species, including dingoes or other wild dogs (Canis lupus dingo and hybrids), cats (Felis catus), foxes (Vulpes vulpes), kangaroos (Macropus giganteus), koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus), livestock guardian dogs (C. l. familiaris), pademelons (Thylogale billardierii), possums (Trichosurus cunninghami), quolls (Dasyurus geoffroii and D. maculatus), wallabies (Macropus rufogriseus and Petrogale lateralis), and wombats (Vombatus ursinus). Common problems encountered were associated with collar design, the GPS, VHF and timed-release components, and unforseen costs in retrieving and refurbishing collars. We discuss the implications of collar failures for research programs and animal welfare, and suggest how these could be avoided or improved. Our intention is to provide constructive advice so that researchers and manufacturers can make informed decisions about using this technology, and maximise the many benefits of GPS while reducing the risks.\n<\/jats:p>",

Quantifying changes in breeding phenology is important for understanding how populations respond to these changes. While data on shifts in phenology are common for Northern Hemisphere species (especially birds), there is a dearth of evidence from the Southern Hemisphere, and even fewer data available from the marine environment. Surface air temperatures at Macquarie Island have increased by 0.62°C during the 30‐year study period (0.21°C decade<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) and royal penguins (<jats:italic>Eudyptes schlegeli<\/jats:italic>) commenced egg laying on average three days earlier in the 1990s than during the 1960s. This contrasts with other studies of Southern Ocean seabirds; five of nine species are now breeding on average 2.1 days later than during the 1950s. Despite the different direction of these trends, they can be explained by a single underlying mechanism: resource availability. There was a negative relationship between the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and median laying date of royal penguins, such that low‐productivity (low SAM) years delayed laying date. This accords with the observations of other seabird species from the Antarctic, where later laying dates were associated with lower sea ice and lower spring productivity. The unifying factor underpinning phenological trends in eastern Antarctica is therefore resource availability; as food becomes scarcer, birds breed later. These changes are not uniform across the region, however, with resource increases in the subantarctic and decreases in eastern Antarctica.<\/jats:p>",

The latter is unacceptable to some animal welfare advocates, even if it ultimately leads to better conservation outcomes. For effective biodiversity conservation it is imperative that conservation and wildlife researchers lucidly present the case for their research on individual animals. This requires conservation biologists and the research community in general, to present these arguments in the public domain as well as in peer-reviewed literature. Moreover, it is important to measure how these activities affect animals.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Survival and reproductive rate estimation requires following uniquely identified individuals through time, and many statistical models assume markings used to identify individuals are permanent. However, survival rates are underestimated when single marks are lost, since the models will effectively score those animals as dead. In order to account for mark loss, some researchers use a double‐mark approach, assuming the probability of losing one mark is independent of losing the other one. Therefore, mark loss can be estimated using animals that have lost one mark. Using a 17‐year dataset of southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) marked with permanent brands and two cattle tags in their hind flippers, we were able to compare tag loss and survival rate estimates with and without the assumption of independent tag loss with respect to age, sex, and wean mass. We demonstrate the assumption of independent tag loss is not valid, showing it is more likely for an animal to lose both tags than just one or the other. The assumption of independent tag loss leads to an underestimate of survival rates which in turn leads to underestimates of population growth rate. In addition, tag loss rates are different by sex and age, with older males more likely to lose tags. Tag loss is also a quadratic function of wean mass through age two, with smaller and larger animals more likely to lose both tags. Such differences are possibly due to differences in behavior, flipper growth, and immune response. Using a Bayesian approach, we will be able to use our tag loss estimates as priors in future analyses for a subset of marked animals that only have flipper tags. With this population, the independent tag loss models are more likely to incorrectly estimate a declining population (growth rate &lt; 1.0), potentially leading to unwarranted management action. To account for non‐independent mark loss in survival rate studies, we recommend researchers use at least two forms of marking on at least a subset of animals. However, neither form of marking need be permanent as long as mark loss is independent between the different forms.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Context Some large herbivores introduced to Australia have achieved population densities so high as to cause considerable ecological damage. Intriguingly, others have been relatively less successful and have correspondingly perturbed their new environments less. An excellent example is two similar-sized bovine species that established feral populations in the Northern Territory of Australia in the mid-19th century. Asian swamp buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) rapidly colonised the tropical savannas, causing ecological degradation, especially on freshwater swamps. In contrast, banteng (Bos javanicus) are restricted to their point of introduction and have caused relatively negligible ecological damage. Understanding the reasons of this differential success is of theoretical and applied interest and contributes to managing large herbivore populations for ex situ conservation and feral-animal control. Aims To compare the population structure of buffalo and banteng on the basis of shot samples, so as to construct life tables for four contemporary (low-density) buffalo populations, and collated data from previous work from three historical (high-density) buffalo populations and one banteng population (the only extant ex situ population in existence). Further, to provide a validation of age estimation with and without informed priors in a Bayesian model comparing horn length and ages estimated from tooth cementum annuli. Finally, to interpret our results in the context of relative invasion potential of the two bovid species. Key Results For both species, survival of juveniles was the most important demographic component influencing deterministic population growth. However, buffalo have the demographic capacity to recover swiftly after control because of high survival and fertility rates across a range of population densities. Fertility of buffalo was historically greater than that of banteng, and buffalo fertility increased as their populations were reduced. Conclusions These findings highlight how subtle differences in demographic rates and feeding ecology can influence the success (high population growth and range expansion) of large herbivores, knowledge which is increasingly important for managing invasive species effectively. Implications We show that that individual life-history traits and demographic performance, especially fertility, play an important role in determining the spread of invasive bovids in a novel environment.<\/jats:p>",

Successful animals generally maximize efficiency or rate of energy gain through foraging. Quantification of all features that modulate energy expenditure can theoretically be modelled as an animal energetic niche or power envelope; with total power being represented by the vertical axis and n-dimensional horizontal axes representing extents of processes that affect energy expenditure. Such an energetic niche could be used to assess the energetic consequences of animals adopting particular behaviours under various environmental conditions. This value of this approach was tested by constructing a simple mechanistic energetics model based on data collected from recording devices deployed on 41 free-living Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus), foraging from four different colonies in Argentina and consequently catching four different types of prey. Energy expenditure was calculated as a function of total distance swum underwater (horizontal axis 1) and maximum depth reached (horizontal axis 2). The resultant power envelope was invariant, irrespective of colony location, but penguins from the different colonies tended to use different areas of the envelope. The different colony solutions appeared to represent particular behavioural options for exploiting the available prey and demonstrate how penguins respond to environmental circumstance (prey distribution), the energetic consequences that this has for them, and how this affects the balance of energy acquisition through foraging and expenditure strategy.<\/jats:p>",

Recently, Brown explored the conservation influence of Steve Irwin. In our commentary, we argue that Irwin was not a conservation champion but an environmental celebrity. His style, while entertaining, was intrusive and his knowledge of biodiversity limited. Nonetheless, his effects to conserve wildlife through land acquisition and popularise conservation will be long lasting. Awareness is key to conservation, and Irwin brought issues to the fore. However, his role in imparting knowledge and respect for animals is debateable. <\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n\nContext. Understanding how the individual movement patterns and dispersion of a population change following wildlife management interventions is crucial for effective population management.\nAims. We quantified the impacts of two wildlife management strategies, a lethal intervention and a subsequent barrier intervention, on localised populations of the two most common macropod species in Tasmania, the Tasmanian pademelon (Thylogale billardierii) and the red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus). This manipulation allowed us to examine two competing hypotheses concerning the distribution of individuals in animal populations – the Ideal Free Distribution (IFD) hypothesis and the Rose Petal (RP) hypothesis. We predicted that the RP would be supported if individuals maintained their previous home ranges following intervention, whereas the IFD would be supported if individuals redistributed following the management interventions.\nMethods. The movement patterns of T. billardierii and M. r. rufogriseus were tracked using GPS technology before and after the two management interventions.\nKey results. Following lethal intervention, pademelons and wallabies (1) maintained their home-range area, (2) increased their utilisation of agricultural habitat and (3) shifted their mean centroid locations compared with the pre-intervention period. Following barrier intervention, pademelons and wallabies (1) maintained their home-range area, (2) decreased their utilisation of agricultural habitat and (3) shifted their mean centroid locations compared with the pre-intervention period.\nConclusions. On the basis of the individual responses of macropods to the management strategies (1) lethal intervention appeared to induce small shifts in home-range distributions of those remaining individuals in the population with home ranges overlapping the areas of lethal intervention and (2) barrier intervention is likely to induce whole-scale population movements of the animals that survive the lethal intervention in their search of an alternative food source. Both species displayed spatial and temporal shifts in their home-range distributions in response to lethal and barrier interventions that appear to conform broadly to predictions of IFD, at least in the timeframe of the present experiment.\nImplications. Wildlife management strategies, which are increasingly constrained by ethical, socio-political and financial considerations, should be based on ecological and behavioural data regarding the likely responses of the target population.\n<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>\n            Polar regions are particularly sensitive to climate change, with the potential for significant feedbacks between ocean circulation, sea ice, and the ocean carbon cycle. However, the difficulty in obtaining\n            <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic>\n            data means that our ability to detect and interpret change is very limited, especially in the Southern Ocean, where the ocean beneath the sea ice remains almost entirely unobserved and the rate of sea-ice formation is poorly known. Here, we show that southern elephant seals (\n            <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>\n            ) equipped with oceanographic sensors can measure ocean structure and water mass changes in regions and seasons rarely observed with traditional oceanographic platforms. In particular, seals provided a 30-fold increase in hydrographic profiles from the sea-ice zone, allowing the major fronts to be mapped south of 60°S and sea-ice formation rates to be inferred from changes in upper ocean salinity. Sea-ice production rates peaked in early winter (April–May) during the rapid northward expansion of the pack ice and declined by a factor of 2 to 3 between May and August, in agreement with a three-dimensional coupled ocean–sea-ice model. By measuring the high-latitude ocean during winter, elephant seals fill a “blind spot” in our sampling coverage, enabling the establishment of a truly global ocean-observing system.\n          <\/jats:p>",

It is often only possible to examine the combined effects of these factors through measurements made over long periods, spanning an array of population densities or levels of food availability. Using age-structured mark-recapture models and datasets spanning five decades (1950–1999), and two periods of differing relative population density, we estimated age-specific probabilities of survival and examined the combined effects of population density and environmental conditions on juvenile survival of southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>First-year survival decreased with density during the period of highest population size, and survival increased during years when the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly (deviation from a 50-year mean) during the mother's previous foraging trip to sea was positive (i.e., El Niño). However, when environmental stochasticity and density were considered together, the effect of density on first-year survival effectively disappeared. Ignoring density effects also leads to models placing too much emphasis on the environmental conditions prevailing during the naïve pup's first year at sea.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Our analyses revealed that both the state of the environment and population density combine to modify juvenile survival, but that the degree to which these processes contributed to the variation observed was interactive and complex. This underlines the importance of evaluating the relative contribution of both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate animal populations because false conclusions regarding the importance of population regulation may be reached if they are examined in isolation.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Climate change is perhaps the most pressing and urgent environmental issue facing the world today. However our ability to predict and quantify the consequences of this change is severely limited by the paucity of in situ oceanographic measurements. Marine animals equipped with sophisticated oceanographic data loggers to study their behavior offer one solution to this problem because marine animals range widely across the world's ocean basins and visit remote and often inaccessible locations. However, unlike the information being collected from conventional oceanographic sensing equipment, which has been validated, the data collected from instruments deployed on marine animals over long periods has not. This is the first long‐term study to validate in situ oceanographic data collected by animal oceanographers. We compared the ocean temperatures collected by leatherback turtles (<jats:italic>Dermochelys coriacea<\/jats:italic>) in the Atlantic Ocean with the ARGO network of ocean floats and could find no systematic errors that could be ascribed to sensor instability. Animal‐borne sensors allowed water temperature to be monitored across a range of depths, over entire ocean basins, and, importantly, over long periods and so will play a key role in assessing global climate change through improved monitoring of global temperatures. This finding is especially pertinent given recent international calls for the development and implementation of a comprehensive Earth observation system (see <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"http://iwgeo.ssc.nasa.gov/documents.asp?s=review\">http://iwgeo.ssc.nasa.gov/documents.asp?s=review<\/jats:ext-link>) that includes the use of novel techniques for monitoring and understanding ocean and climate interactions to address strategic environmental and societal needs.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Maternal and physical factors play a significant role in animal life-history variability, which means that large scale climate change has the potential to affect the size and dynamics of animal populations indirectly through maternal investment and directly through conditions that animals are exposed to. However, little is known about the effects of large-scale oceanographic events such as the El-Niño southern oscillation (ENSO) that influence productivity in the Southern Ocean and the abundance, quality and distribution of prey. The possible mechanisms by which physical factors and primary productivity could influence life-history traits, such as survival of apex predators, includes direct influences such as food availability and foraging success and indirect influences such as stored maternal investment and resource transfer during lactation. Here, we quantify the relative contribution of maternal investment and climate conditions at remote foraging sites to survival in the first year of life for southern elephant seals. We present evidence linking climate (ENSO) and variations in a key demographic parameter—first-year survival—and demonstrate that survival was highest during ENSO events and that the ability of mothers to store and acquire resources, which is typically related to ocean productivity, is the most important determinant of survival in the first year. This functional link provides valuable insights that can be used to model the responses of the seal populations to climate change scenarios.<\/jats:p>",

We assessed temporal changes in the quality of 4932 brands applied in 1998 and 1999 to determine the duration of the brand wound, and the relationships between brand healing, brand readability and the amount of skin and hair damage peripheral to the brand characters. Most (98%) brand wounds were healed within one year. Brand-mark healing, peripheral skin damage and brand readability were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) correlated. The proportion of healed and readable brands increased in the population during the first annual moult, and thereafter these proportions remained high (&gt;95%) for the marked population. The mean number of brand characters with peripheral skin damage decreased significantly over the same period. The seal’s annual hair and skin moult is the process that contributed most to the healing of brand wounds. We also assessed our branding technique to determine whether any of the features we measured contributed to a poor-quality brand. Excessive pressure used during brand-iron application is the most probable cause of unsightly peripheral skin damage, but this damage is short lived.\n<\/jats:p>",

There are two possible reasons: (1) the population at Marion Island is smaller and less dense than at Macquarie Island and (2) seals hauled out along a smaller section of the coast at Marion Island than at Macquarie Island, which: (1) facilitates the detection and individual identification of seals and (2) increases access to hauled out seals.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Age‐specific survival estimates (corrected for preweaning mortality and tag loss) differed (<jats:inline-graphic xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\" xlink:href=\"graphic/JANE_685_mu2.gif\" xlink:title=\"inline image\" /> = 22·264, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> &lt; 0·05) at the two islands and were consistently higher at Macquarie Island.

Female survival estimates were higher than male survival estimates. The combined survival estimates for juvenile seals (1–3 years) differed between islands but survival of older seals (4–6 years) did not. The inclusion of gender in the survival models did not improve model performance and hence male and female estimates were considered jointly.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The mean wean masses of male and female seals combined from 1993 to 1998 were not different between islands (T<jats:sub>6837<\/jats:sub> = 1·169, <jats:italic>P<\/jats:italic> = 0·242).

Assessments were made of the effects of variations in the body condition and age at capture of the seals on the characteristics of their anaesthesia, including induction time and weighted recovery time. The size and condition of the seals were assessed by morphometric and ultrasound measurements. Weighted recovery times decreased as the body condition and age of the seals increased, but there were no residual effects of sex. There were no fatalities, and no periods of apnoea longer than five minutes were recorded. In individual seals there was a significant increase in weighted recovery time with successive captures.<\/jats:p>",

The virus displayed classic alphavirus ultrastructure and appeared to be serologically different from known Australasian alphaviruses. Nearly all Macquarie Island elephant seals tested had neutralizing antibodies against the virus, but no virus-associated pathology has been identified. Antarctic Division personnel who have worked extensively with elephant seals showed no serological evidence of exposure to the virus. Sequence analysis illustrated that the southern elephant seal (SES) virus segregates with the Semliki Forest group of Australasian alphaviruses. Phylogenetic analysis of known alphaviruses suggests that alphaviruses might be grouped according to their enzootic vertebrate host class. The SES virus represents the first arbovirus of marine mammals and illustrates that alphaviruses can inhabit Antarctica and that alphaviruses can be transmitted by lice.\n          <\/jats:p>",

Uneroded sagittal otoliths were used\nto identify teleost fish and to calculate fish size. Prey items included 14\ntaxa of teleost fish, cephalopods, gastropods, crustaceans and fur seals. Fish\nconstituted the primary component of the diet. Prey species previously\nuncommon in the diet of seals and penguins around Macquarie Island were\ncommonly eaten by Hooker's sea lions. The sub-Antarctic horse fish\n(Zanclorhynchus spinifer) and the Patagonian tooth fish\n(Dissostichus eleginoides) were the two most abundant\nspecies and occurred in 62.5% and 41.7% of all scats\nrespectively. There were no age-specific and individual differences in the\ndiet of sea lions. Seasonal variances in diet were absent. Small plastic\nfragments (diameter ∼1 mm) were found only in association with otoliths of\nElectrona subaspera. Some overlap was seen between the\ndiet of itinerant male Hooker's sea lions and the commercial fisheries\nthat currently operate around Macquarie Island.<\/jats:p>",

Butterflies were sampled from 15 sites and genotyped, first using 363 informative AFLP bands and then using 17 polymorphic allozyme loci (<jats:italic>n <\/jats:italic>=<jats:italic> <\/jats:italic>248 and 254, respectively). We complemented these analyses with phylogeographic information based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype information derived from a previous study in the same landscapes.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results <\/jats:bold> Both datasets indicated a relatively high level of genetic structuring across the sampling range (AFLP, <jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>ST<\/jats:sub> = 0.34; allozyme, <jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>ST<\/jats:sub> = 0.13): structure was greatest among populations in the fragmented landscape (AFLP, <jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>ST<\/jats:sub> = 0.15; allozyme, <jats:italic>F<\/jats:italic><jats:sub>ST<\/jats:sub> = 0.13). Populations in the fragmented landscape also had significantly lower genetic diversity than populations in the other two landscapes: there were no detectable differences in genetic diversity between the two continuous landscapes. There was also evidence (<jats:italic>r<\/jats:italic><jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup> = 0.33) of an isolation by distance effect across the sampled range of the species.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Main conclusions <\/jats:bold> The multiple lines of evidence, presented within a phylogeographic context, support the hypothesis that contemporary habitat fragmentation has been a major driver of genetic erosion and differentiation in this species. <jats:italic>Theclinesthes albocincta<\/jats:italic> populations in the fragmented landscape are thus likely to be at greater risk of extinction because of reduced genetic diversity, their isolation from conspecific subpopulations in other landscapes, and other extrinsic forces acting on their small population sizes. Our study provides compelling evidence that habitat loss and fragmentation have significant rapid impacts on the genetic diversity and structure of butterfly populations, especially specialist species with particular habitat preferences and poor dispersal abilities.<\/jats:p>",

Migratory tracks and ocean areas with concentrated activity, presumed to be foraging grounds, were established from location data gathered by attached geolocation-time depth recorders. The seals ranged widely (811–3258 km) and foraging activity centred on oceanographic frontal systems, especially the Antarctic Polar Front and bathymetric features such as the Campbell Plateau region. The seals spent 58.6% of their sea time within managed fishery areas while the remainder was spent on the high seas, an area of unregulated fishing. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) areas 58.4.1, 88.2 and especially 88.1 were important and distant foraging areas for these juvenile elephant seals. From fisheries records, diet and the foraging ecology studies of the seals there appears to be little, if any, overlap or conflict between the seals and commercial fishing operations within the regulated commercial areas. However, attention is drawn to the possibility of future interactions if Southern Ocean fisheries expand or new ones commence.<\/jats:p>",

However, establishing the implications of climate change for the range of endangered species is problematic as historic data are often lacking. We therefore used a different approach to predict the implications of climate change for the range of the critically endangered planktivourous leatherback turtle (<jats:italic>Dermochelys coriacea<\/jats:italic>). We used long‐term satellite telemetry to define the habitat utilization of this species. We show that the northerly distribution limit of this species can essentially be encapsulated by the position of the 15°C isotherm and that the summer position of this isotherm has moved north by 330 km in the North Atlantic in the last 17 years. Consequently, conservation measures will need to operate over ever‐widening areas to accommodate this range extension.<\/jats:p>",

One colony, located on the isthmus when the island was discovered in 1810, was extinct by 1894 and it took about 100 years for king penguins to re-establish a viable breeding population there. Here we document this recovery. The first eggs laid at Gadget Gully on the isthmus were recorded in late February 1995 but in subsequent years egg laying took place earlier between November and February (this temporal discontinuity is a consequence of king penguin breeding behaviour). The first chick was hatched in April 1995 but the first fledging was not raised until the following breeding season in October 1996. The colony increased on average 66% per annum in the five years between 1995 and 2000. King penguins appear resilient to catastrophic population reductions, and as the island's population increases, it is likely that other previously abandoned breeding sites will be reoccupied.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) typically give birth to a single pup and raise it over a short 24-day lactation period. Lactation is characterised by: maternal fasting, rapid pup growth and abrupt weaning after which the weaned pups rely on stored fat for growth and survival. Females are not able to transfer all of their stored resources to their pups because they themselves need to use some to return to their remote foraging grounds after the breeding effort. Therefore the amount of energy expended by a female during lactation may affect not only the survival of her pup, but her own survival and future reproductive success. Female southern elephant seals are therefore under strong selective pressure to allocate finite amounts of resources to their pups. In the rare event of producing twins, females that wean both pups are likely to experience reduced reproductive success. Twin births accounted for 0.38% of all the observed elephant seal births at Macquarie Island in 1999. The mean birth masses, weaning lengths and lactation duration for twin and singleton pups did not differ significantly but weaning mass, weaning girths and lactation growth rates did differ significantly. In all cases, singleton pups were larger and grew faster than twin pups. Twin pups suffered greater pre-weaning mortality than singletons (16.7% and 4.6% respectively) and fewer were seen alive after 18 months (20% compared with 47% respectively). <\/jats:p>",

In modern times two bovines, the Asian water buffalo (<jats:italic>Bubalus bubalis<\/jats:italic>) and banteng (<jats:italic>Bos javanicus<\/jats:italic>), have established feral populations in the Northern Territory, Australia. Buffalo have aggressively expanded throughout the savanna landscape, yet banteng remain near their point of introduction on the Cobourg Peninsula. We hypothesized that this difference is related to feeding ecology, possibly reflecting a legacy of the Pleistocene extinctions.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Location <\/jats:bold> Western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory, Australia.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Methods <\/jats:bold> Analysing a previously published dataset of body mass and feeding ecology of extinct and extant marsupial herbivores, we evaluated whether browsers were at greater risk of extinction than grazers. We compared the carbon isotope composition and nitrogen content of banteng and buffalo dung in order to evaluate the hypotheses that the differences in invasion success are related to feeding ecology, and that seasonal variation in browse consumption is linked to changing nutritional quality of grass.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Results <\/jats:bold> Controlling for body mass, the Pleistocene extinctions were clearly biased towards browsers. Introduced banteng appear to be primarily browsers, with their diets comprising 40% grass in the wet season and 15% in the late dry season. Buffalo have a more variable diet, with an increasing proportion of browse from the wet (30%) to the late dry season (75%), and can therefore be described as switching from grazer to browser. The decline of grass in the diet of both species appears to reflect the decline in the nutritional value of grass through the dry season, an inference supported by the negative relationship between δ<jats:sup>13<\/jats:sup>C values and the nitrogen content of dung.<\/jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Main conclusions <\/jats:bold> Banteng and buffalo are much larger than extant native herbivores, of which browsers are restricted to isolated rocky habitats. This suggests that banteng and buffalo have filled niches made vacant following the Pleistocene extinctions. The success of buffalo appears to be related to their greater dietary breadth, which enables them to graze and browse in eucalypt savannas, whilst the browsing banteng remain tethered to a mosaic of rain forest patches. The restriction of browsers may be a long‐range consequence of habitat transformations associated with Aboriginal landscape burning.<\/jats:p>",

Crabeater seals were not uniformly distributed in the polynya but selected areas of stable ice over shallow (&lt; 1000 m) waters. We used a generalized linear model to assess the relationship of seal distribution to the physical attributes of sea ice concentration, thickness, and ocean depth. We found that ice thickness and ocean depth were the most important determinants of seal distribution. Crabeater seals occurred in areas where the ice affords them a stable haulout platform while allowing them access to Antarctic krill that live directly beneath the ice.<\/jats:p>",

In southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>), however, offspring receive no knowledge from their parents, only fat reserves. This research focuses on how dispersal direction on their maiden foraging trip and physical traits influence the survival of naïve southern elephant seal pups at Macquarie Island. We tracked 44 pups with satellite tags during their post-weaning migration and compared their movements to the post-moult winter migrations of 58 adult females. We found that most pups (61.2%) travelled southeast, in line with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Pups travelling with the predominant east-southeast current had a 1.5 times higher survival rate for their first trip than those swimming westward against it. Those that swam with the current and were heavier were more likely to survive their first year. Adult females showed different dispersal patterns, where they travelled southwards towards Antarctic waters, implying that learning from experience influences their direction. Future investigations into the role of the primary eastward current in the sub-Antarctic on circumpolar movement patterns of top marine predators could expand our understanding of Southern Ocean ecology.<\/jats:p>",

This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of oceanographic parameters in the southern waters of Australia (36–43°S, 136–141°E) associated with the Bonney Upwelling (shelf) and subtropical front (STF; oceanic). Using satellite data from 1997 to 2016, we found that productive oceanic waters were associated with the STF and eddy activity; they were generally furthest from the shelf break in spring–summer (upwelling season on the shelf) and closest to the shelf break in winter–autumn (downwelling season on the shelf). Inter-annual variabilities of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a), sea-surface temperature and sea surface-height anomaly were generally higher in summer than in winter for both shelf and oceanic waters. El Niño–Southern Oscillation, Southern Annular Mode and Indian Ocean Dipole were cross-correlated with anomalous shelf and oceanic Chl-a at various lagged times (range=15–0 months). This study provides a regional perspective of the spatial and temporal oceanographic variability in southern Australian waters, which may help with understanding apex-predator ecology in the ecosystem.\n<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Anthropogenic climate change is resulting in spatial redistributions of many species. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on an abundant and widely distributed group of diving birds, <jats:italic>Eudyptes<\/jats:italic> penguins, which are the main avian consumers in the Southern Ocean in terms of biomass consumption. Despite their abundance, several of these species have undergone population declines over the past century, potentially due to changing oceanography and prey availability over the important winter months. We used light‐based geolocation tracking data for 485 individuals deployed between 2006 and 2020 across 10 of the major breeding locations for five taxa of <jats:italic>Eudyptes<\/jats:italic> penguins. We used boosted regression tree modelling to quantify post‐moult habitat preference for southern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. chrysocome<\/jats:italic>), eastern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. filholi<\/jats:italic>), northern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. moseleyi<\/jats:italic>) and macaroni/royal (<jats:italic>E. chrysolophus<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>E. schlegeli<\/jats:italic>) penguins. We then modelled their redistribution under two climate change scenarios, representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (for the end of the century, 2071–2100). As climate forcings differ regionally, we quantified redistribution in the Atlantic, Central Indian, East Indian, West Pacific and East Pacific regions. We found sea surface temperature and sea surface height to be the most important predictors of current habitat for these penguins; physical features that are changing rapidly in the Southern Ocean. Our results indicated that the less severe RCP4.5 would lead to less habitat loss than the more severe RCP8.5. The five taxa of penguin may experience a general poleward redistribution of their preferred habitat, but with contrasting effects in the (i) change in total area of preferred habitat under climate change (ii) according to geographic region and (iii) the species (macaroni/royal vs. rockhopper populations). Our results provide further understanding on the regional impacts and vulnerability of species to climate change.<\/jats:p>",

Toward understanding krill's response to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg production, with predation pressure post‐spawning, to predict regions of high‐quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all predicted high‐quality spawning habitat. Small‐scale management units (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high‐quality spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Biophysical interactions are influential in determining the scale of key ecological processes within marine ecosystems. For oceanic predators, this means foraging behaviour is influenced by processes shaping the distribution of prey. However, oceanic prey is difficult to observe and its abundance and distribution is regionally generalised. We use a spatiotemporally resolved simulation model to describe mid‐trophic prey distribution within the Southern Ocean and demonstrate insights that this modelled prey field provides into the foraging behaviour of a widely distributed marine predator, the southern elephant seal.<\/jats:p><jats:p>From a five‐year simulation of prey biomass, we computed climatologies of mean prey biomass (average prey conditions) and prey biomass variability (meso‐scale variability). We also compiled spatially gridded metrics of seal density and diving behaviour from 13 yr of tracking data. We statistically modelled these metrics as non‐linear functions of prey biomass (both mean and variability) and used these to predict seal distribution and behaviour. Our predictions were consistent with observations (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>adj<\/jats:sub> = 0.23), indicating that seals aggregate in regions of high mesoscale activity where eddies concentrate prey. Here, seals dived deeper (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.12, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.51) and spent less time hunting (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.05, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.56), likely targeting deep but profitable prey patches. Seals generally avoided areas of low eddy activity where prey was likely dispersed. Most seals foraged south of the Subantarctic Front, despite north of the front exhibiting consistently high simulated prey biomasses. This likely reflects seal prey or habitat preferences, but also emphasises the importance of mesoscale prey biomass variability relative to regionally high mean biomass. This work demonstrates the value of coupling mechanistic representations of prey biomass with predator observations to provide insight into how biophysical processes combine to shape species distributions. This will be increasingly important for the robust prediction of species’ responses to rapid system change.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Seabirds are highly vocal on land where acoustic communication plays a crucial role in reproduction. Yet, seabirds spend most of their life at sea. They have developed a number of morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations to forage in the marine environment. The use of acoustic signals at sea could potentially enhance seabirds’ foraging success, but remains largely unexplored. Penguins emit vocalisations from the sea surface when commuting, a behaviour possibly associated with group formation at sea. Still, they are unique in their exceptional diving abilities and feed entirely underwater. Other air-breathing marine predators that feed under water, like cetaceans, pinnipeds and marine turtles, are known to emit sound underwater, but such behaviour has not yet been described in seabirds. We aimed to assess the potential prevalence and diversity of vocalisations emitted underwater by penguins. We chose three study species from three different genera, and equipped foraging adults with video cameras with built-in microphones. We recorded a total of 203 underwater vocalisation from all three species during 4 h 43 min of underwater footage. Vocalisations were very short in duration (0.06 s on average), with a frequency of maximum amplitude averaging 998 Hz, 1097 Hz and 680 Hz for King, Gentoo and Macaroni penguins, respectively. All vocalisations were emitted during feeding dives and more than 50% of them were directly associated with hunting behaviour, preceeded by an acceleration (by 2.2 s on average) and/or followed by a prey capture attempt (after 0.12 s on average). The function of these vocalisations remain speculative. Although it seems to be related to hunting behaviour, these novel observations warrant further investigation.<\/jats:p>",

Altered prey assemblages resulting from fluctuations in oceanographic conditions may be mirrored by shifts in seabird diet. Long-term studies of dietary change in seabirds therefore provide valuable insight into the nature of environmental shifts within the systems in which they forage. In recent decades, the Agulhas region in South Africa has undergone significant oceanographic change related to warming and intensification of the Agulhas current. Concurrent with this change, the population of Cape gannets Morus capensis at Bird Island, Algoa Bay, has grown rapidly, probably as a result of an increased availability of its dominant prey items, sardine Sardinops sagax and anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus. Using one of the longest and most complete time-series available on diet of a seabird (spanning 34 years), we tested for changes in composition and the abundance of dominant prey species of this population. These observed changes were also compared with acoustic survey estimates of their biomass, and annual catch data. Since 1979, the prey composition has remained similar, but the dietary contribution of sardine and anchovy, which fluctuated inversely to each other, increased over the study period. These shifts seem to be reflective of fluctuations in the stock size of sardine and anchovy. Conversely, a third species, saury Scomberesox saurus, dominant in the non-breeding diet of the 1980s, decreased significantly in dietary abundance over the following two decades. It is likely that dietary shifts of Cape gannets at Bird Island were related to climate-mediated oceanographic change. The implications of such changes are discussed.<\/jats:p>",

The impact of these threats is exacerbated in long‐lived species with low reproductive output and high investment in a few offspring, where juvenile survival is of substantial importance to populations. Changes to post‐fledging survival and recruitment of adults are difficult to detect, necessitating better information to forecast juvenile survival before fledglings take to sea. To achieve this goal, we test the hypothesis that there is an ideal mass range for fledglings, outside of which survival is limited, providing an early warning signal for future recruitment failures. Here we present a long‐term study of chick banding, weighing and resighting of wedge‐tailed shearwaters, <jats:italic>Ardenna pacifica<\/jats:italic>, a globally widespread but declining tropical/subtropical seabird in a sea‐surface warming hotspot across a span of 43 years. We provide data on 1615 fledgling birds banded most years between 1977 and 2020, with 111 resighted as adults. We found that fledglings weighing 380–470 g have the best chance to survive to adulthood and those weighing 330–540 g have a possible chance of survival. We detected a gradual decline in masses since data collection began, with chicks fledging, on average, 1.6 g lighter each year. This decline has been sharpest since 1996, with fledging masses decreasing at an average rate of 3.8 g annually. Should this 1.6 g decline continue, the average fledgling will cross out of the ‘survivable’ mass range by 2047/2048. We contextualise these findings with observed declines reported in some populations across the species South Pacific range, adding to the conversation about challenges to seabirds in regions experiencing rapid change.<\/jats:p>",

Most plastic pollution originates from land-based sources and is transported via rivers, where plastic densities can exceed those at sea. Rivers in southeast Asia are regularly identified among those transporting the greatest plastic loads globally, yet are among the least studied major river systems. This is particularly concerning since they provide habitat for commercially, culturally and ecologically important species. We present a four-step risk framework to assess the relative risk to wildlife at different sections of a river, particularly where data may be sparse. We apply this method to a case study in the Ganges and Mekong rivers. The first step is to estimate litter density and abandoned fishing gear (ALDFG) to determine the relative level of pressure from ingestion or entanglement. Step two uses a risk assessment to determine the likelihood of a species interacting with a given item, and the further likelihood of a negative outcome of that encounter. Step three determines the overlap of the habitat of the species with the litter present in the environment, and the final step integrates all of these factors to present an overall relative risk to migratory species within each watershed. In the Ganges and Mekong rivers, entanglement represents the highest risk to species. The methods presented here estimate the relative risk to vertebrate fauna from litter interactions in rivers where empirical data are not available, aiming to determine (i) where in each river do we expect to find the most plastic and ALDFG and (ii) whether species suspected to be threatened by plastic pollution overlap with these predicted high-risk regions. This approach will aid decision-makers to make informed precautionary assessments bridging data gaps about relative plastic loads and associated risks in aquatic systems, until empirical data becomes available.<\/jats:p>",

We suggest these results reflect the dominance of pelagic crustaceans in the diet of smaller seabirds, blooms of which are influenced by input of limiting ocean nutrients. Cluster analysis revealed three broad groups of feather elements: large seabirds, and small seabirds in each of the South Pacific and South Atlantic Ocean basins. High concentrations of some elements in feathers match seawater availability and are detectable in lower‐trophic feeding seabirds with local movements. Conversely, the element fingerprints of longer‐distance, higher‐trophic foragers, including albatrosses, do not match availability in seawater at the collection site.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Main conclusions<\/jats:title><jats:p>The feather element concentrations of shorter‐range foraging, lower‐trophic feeding seabirds vary significantly among ocean basins, reflecting availability in seawater, while longer‐range, higher‐trophic species do not.

By examining carcasses of seabirds that ingested pumice of known provenance prior to death, we provide insights into whether wild animals starve because they have eaten non-food, or whether they eat non-food because they are starving. We investigated ingestion of pumice and plastic in carcasses of short-tailed shearwaters<jats:italic>Ardenna tenuirostris<\/jats:italic>following a significant starvation mortality event (also known as seabird wreck), during which millions of shearwaters died along the eastern Australian coastline in 2013. We found that the stomachs of 96.5% of 172 seabirds sampled contained pumice or plastic at the time of death. We used global location sensors to track the 2013 shearwater migration and overlaid these tracks with the dispersing pumice raft from the 2012 Havre underwater volcanic eruption, Kermadec Islands, New Zealand. We determined that shearwaters in a starved state had ingested pumice 12-41 h before death, indicating that starving or food-stressed seabirds exhibit reduced prey discrimination. The provenance of the ingested plastic was not known. Ingestion of non-nutritive items has serious implications for wildlife, particularly long-lived or migrating species. Additional risk to already nutritionally compromised animals includes dietary dilution, gastric foreign body obstruction and toxicity. With a projected changing climate and increased marine pollution and over-exploitation of resources, this study has implications for the interaction of stressors, mass mortalities and exacerbation of existing threats to marine species.<\/jats:p>",

The problem is so large that prioritizing solutions to effect meaningful change may seem overwhelming to the public and policy makers. Marine megafauna are known to mistakenly eat anthropogenic debris and die from consequent gastrointestinal blockages, perforations and malnutrition, as well as suffer sublethal impacts. We collated information on which specific items were ingested and responsible for causing death across 80 marine species, including cetaceans, pinnipeds, sea turtles, and seabirds. We evaluated which items were responsible for the highest mortality, and which, if reduced by policy responses or other means, could result in the largest reduction in debris mortality. A limited number of consumer items were shown to be responsible for most megafauna deaths. Flexible plastic is responsible for the largest proportion of debris deaths, primarily due to gastric obstructions. Disproportionately lethal items included plastic bags/sheets/packaging, rope/fishing nets, fishing tackle and balloons/latex. Smaller items, including “microplastics,” though abundant, were seldom implicated in mortality. We provide suggestions to directly curb debris deaths of marine megafauna by prioritizing policies that would reduce or eliminate the input of disproportionately hazardous items into the marine system.<\/jats:p>",

Metal(loid)s may interact with plastic in the environment and there is mixed evidence about whether plastic ingested by wildlife affects metal(loid) absorption/assimilation and concentration in the body. We examined ingested plastic and liver concentration of eleven metal(loid)s in two seabird species: fairy (<jats:italic>Pachyptila turtur<\/jats:italic>) and slender-billed prions (<jats:italic>P. belcheri<\/jats:italic>). We found significant relationships between ingested plastic and the concentrations of aluminium (Al), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) in the liver of prions. We investigated whether the pattern of significant relationships reflected plastic-metal(loid) associations predicted in the scientific literature, including by transfer of metals from ingested plastics or malnutrition due to dietary dilution by plastics in the gut. We found some support for both associations, suggesting that ingested plastic may be connected with dietary dilution / lack of essential nutrients, especially iron, and potential transfer of zinc. We did not find a relationship between plastic and non-essential metal(loid)s, including lead. The effect of plastic was minor compared to that of dietary exposure to metal(oid)s, and small plastic loads (&lt; 3 items) had no discernible link with metal(loid)s. This new evidence shows a relationship between plastic ingestion and liver metal(loid) concentrations in free-living wildlife.<\/jats:p>",

To understand the consequences of marine debris to wildlife populations, studies must go beyond reporting the incidence of wildlife and debris interactions and aim to quantify the harm resulting from these interactions. Tubenosed seabirds are globally threatened, with a near universal risk of debris ingestion and an unquantified risk of mortality due to eating plastics. In this paper, we explore the mortality risk narrative due to the acute effects of debris ingestion, and quantify behavioural and ecological factors including age, diet and foraging method. We examined ingested debris loads, types and mortality of 972 adult and immature seabirds across 17 albatross, shearwater and prion species in a global seabird biodiversity hotspot. Though age and foraging method interact to influence the incidence and number of items ingested, age and diet were the most important factors influencing mortality. Mortality is influenced by debris load and type of debris ingested and there is selectivity for items that visually resemble a seabird’s prey. Immature birds that forage on cephalopods are more likely to ingest and die from eating debris than are adults. Conversely, the risk of death to seabirds that forage on crustaceans is linked to the number of plastic items ingested and is higher in adults. Debris ingestion is an under-recognised cause of tubenose mortality and is likely negatively affecting rare and threatened species.<\/jats:p>",

Ingestion of plastic is a well‐recognized threat among three North Pacific species, but lesser known in the southern hemisphere, where it is considered a minor threat. As plastic entering the ocean is increasing while albatross populations decline, the threat of ocean plastic to albatross populations may be underestimated. We present case studies of 107 beach‐cast albatrosses of twelve species, received by wildlife hospitals in Australia and New Zealand, and estimate plastic ingestion and mortality rates for albatrosses in the southern hemisphere. Ingested plastic was present in 5.6% of individuals, and the cause of death in half of these cases. We estimate ingestion of plastic may cause 3.4–17.5% of nearshore mortalities and is worth consideration as a substantial threat to albatross populations. We provide clinical findings and “checklist” methodologies for identifying potential cases of foreign‐body gastrointestinal obstruction. We suggest practical policy responses, empowering decision makers to reduce albatross mortality from anthropogenic sources.<\/jats:p>",

Marine debris ingestion is a globally recognized threat to marine biodiversity, yet the relationship between how much debris a bird ingests and mortality remains poorly understood. Using cause of death data from 1733 seabirds of 51 species, we demonstrate a significant relationship between ingested debris and a debris-ingestion cause of death (dose-response). There is a 20.4% chance of lifetime mortality from ingesting a single debris item, rising to 100% after consuming 93 items. Obstruction of the gastro-intestinal tract is the leading cause of death. Overall, balloons are the highest-risk debris item; 32 times more likely to result in death than ingesting hard plastic. These findings have significant implications for quantifying seabird mortality due to debris ingestion, and provide identifiable policy targets aimed to reduce mortality for threatened species worldwide.<\/jats:p>",

We examined the incidence and ecological factors associated with marine debris ingestion in Procellariiformes by examining seabirds collected at a global seabird hotspot, the Australasian - Southern Ocean boundary. We examined marine debris ingestion trends in 1734 individuals of 51 Procellariform species, finding significant variation in the incidence of marine debris abundance among species. Variation in the incidence of marine debris ingestion between species was influenced by the taxonomy, foraging ecology, diet, and foraging range overlaps with oceanic regions polluted with marine debris. Among the ecological drivers of marine debris ingestion variability in Procellariiformes, we demonstrate that the combination of taxonomy, foraging method, diet, and exposure to marine debris are the most important determinants of incidence of ingestion. We use these results to develop a global forecast for Procellariiform taxa at the risk of highest incidence of marine debris ingestion. We find seabirds that forage at the surface; especially by surface seizing, diving and filtering, those with a crustacean dominant diet, and those that forage in or near marine debris hotspots are at highest risk of debris ingestion. We predict that family with the highest risk are the storm petrels (<jats:italic>Hydrobatidae<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Oceanitidae<\/jats:italic>). We demonstrate that the greater the exposure of high-risk groups to marine debris while foraging, the greater the incidence and number of marine debris items will be ingested.<\/jats:p>",

In southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>), however, offspring receive no knowledge from their parents, only fat reserves. This research focuses on how dispersal direction on their maiden foraging trip and physical traits influence the survival of naïve southern elephant seal pups at Macquarie Island. We tracked 44 pups with satellite tags during their post-weaning migration and compared their movements to the post-moult winter migrations of 58 adult females. We found that most pups (61.2%) travelled southeast, in line with the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Pups travelling with the predominant east-southeast current had a 1.5 times higher survival rate for their first trip than those swimming westward against it. Those that swam with the current and were heavier were more likely to survive their first year. Adult females showed different dispersal patterns, where they travelled southwards towards Antarctic waters, implying that learning from experience influences their direction. Future investigations into the role of the primary eastward current in the sub-Antarctic on circumpolar movement patterns of top marine predators could expand our understanding of Southern Ocean ecology.<\/jats:p>",

However, large areas of the East Antarctic continental shelf remain poorly observed, making it challenging to determine if the supply of oceanic heat to the ice shelves is changing. Here, we use temperature and salinity profiles to the west of the Shackleton Ice Shelf (SIS; ≈100°E) spanning 60 years to assess the variability of the water masses in the context of a changing climate. We document warming and freshening of shelf waters. Prior to 1996, cold mCDW water (<jats:italic>θ<\/jats:italic> &lt; −1.6°C) was found below the surface mixed layer and cold Dense Shelf Water (DSW) with a salinity of &gt;34.5 dominated the water column. After 2010, warm mCDW (≥−1.0°C) was widespread over the continental shelf and DSW with salinity over 34.5 was no longer present. The mixing ratio of glacial meltwater indicates that warm mCDW observed in 2011 caused basal melting of the SIS, possibly reducing the salinity of DSW. Increased access of warm waters to the continental shelf may have also occurred on the eastern side of the ice shelf, where glaciological evidence shows the grounding line has retreated. These observations suggest a shift occurred prior to 2011 that has increased the ocean heat supply to the continental shelf and to the SIS, increasing basal melt and reducing DSW formation.<\/jats:p>",

One of the rarest pinnipeds, the New Zealand sea lion (NZSL, <jats:italic>Phocarctos hookeri<\/jats:italic>) has a very restricted breeding range. At Campbell Island/Motu Ihupuku, one of the two primary breeding sites, at‐sea foraging behaviour is unknown. We hypothesised that NZSL of various sex and age classes would utilise the water column differently due to differing physiological constraints and therefore have different accessibility to prey resources. We tested whether sea lion diving behaviour varied in relation to (i) age and sex class, (ii) time of day and (iii) water depth. We also hypothesised that the proportion of benthic/pelagic diving, and consequently risk of fisheries interaction, would vary in relation to age and sex. Satellite telemetry tags were deployed on 25 NZSL from a range of age/sex classes recording dive depth, duration and location. Adult females and juveniles used inshore, benthic habitats, while sub‐adult males also utilised benthic habitats, they predominantly used pelagic habitat at greater distances from the island. Adult females and juveniles exhibited shorter dives than the same age/sex classes at the Auckland Islands, suggesting a lower dive effort for these age/sex classes at Campbell Island/Motu Ihupuku. Adult females dived more frequently than other age/sex classes, likely operating closer to their physiological limits; however, further data for this age class is needed. Sub‐adult male use of pelagic prey may increase their exposure to mid‐water trawls; however, further research detailing the degree of spatial overlap with fisheries is required. This study highlights the utility of spatially explicit dive data to predict vertical habitat use, niche separation of various age and sex classes of marine predators and attribute potential fisheries interaction risk in relation to predator habitat use.<\/jats:p>",

Southern elephant seal (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) pups wean at approximately three weeks of age and depart on their first foraging trips in midsummer, typically remaining at sea for three to four months before returning to their natal islands. We describe the foraging trips (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 29) of 16 underyearling southern elephant seals from sub‐Antarctic Marion Island and compare these with trips (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 152) of 94 older seals from the same population. While subadults (prebreeding age) and adult females (breeding age) displayed directional travel, underyearlings traveled in multiple directions from the island with no evidence of repeatability of travel directions within or between individuals and years. Maiden trips took longer to complete than subsequent trips during the first year of life, but we found no evidence for significant changes in other track metrics between the first three foraging trips. The comparatively inconsistent movement patterns of underyearlings suggest that foraging strategies of individuals are influenced by their learning and/or success during the first year of life and that individual level consistency in successful foraging strategies only become apparent in subsequent years.<\/jats:p>",

Continental shelf bathymetry influences warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water movement onto the shelf, making it an important factor promoting ice shelf melting and influencing the flow of ice shelves into the ocean. Building on previous work using seal dives to redefine bathymetry, our longitudinal study of ocean physics and animal behaviour provided new depth information from over 500,000 individual seal dives on the East Antarctic continental shelf. About 25% of these seal dives were 220 m (sometimes over 1000 m) deeper than the interpolated seafloor from IBCSO V2. Focusing on four well-sampled regions, we show that the bathymetry of 22% to 60% of the sampled area was improved by incorporating seal dive data. This revealed new bathymetric features, including troughs off the Shackleton Ice Shelf and Underwood Glacier and a deep canyon near the Vanderford Glacier. This deep canyon, the <jats:italic>Mirounga-Nuyina Canyon<\/jats:italic>, was confirmed by a recent multi-beam echo sounder survey. Further acquisitions of seal data will improve our understanding and modelling of Antarctic coastal ocean processes and ice-sheet dynamics.<\/jats:p>",

Southern elephant seals (\n            <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>\n            ) are highly dimorphic and extremely polygynous marine mammals. A demographic model, supported by long-term capture–mark–recapture records, investigated the influence of sex and age on survival in this species. The study revealed clear differences between female and male age-dependent survival rates. Overall juvenile survival estimates were stable around 80–85% for both sexes. However, male survival estimates were 5–10% lower than females in the same age classes until 8 years of age. At this point, male survival decreased rapidly to 50% ± 10% while female estimates remained constant at 80% ± 5%. Different energetic requirements could underpin intersex differences in adult survival. However, the species' strong sexual dimorphism diverges during early juvenile development when sex-specific survival rates were less distinct. Maximizing growth is especially advantageous for males, with size being a major determinant of breeding probability. Maturing males may employ a high-risk high-reward foraging strategy to compensate for extensive sexual selection pressures and sex-specific energetic needs. Our findings suggest sex-specific adult survival is a result of\n            <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic>\n            ecological interactions and evolutionary specialization associated with being a highly polygynous marine predator.\n          <\/jats:p>",

This is particularly true in the Southern Ocean, where mesopelagic fishes are both key predators and prey, but where the remote environment makes sampling challenging. Despite this, multiple national Antarctic research programs have undertaken regional sampling of mesopelagic fish over several decades. However, data are dispersed, and sampling methodologies often differ precluding comparisons and limiting synthetic analyses. We identified potential data holders by compiling a metadata catalogue of existing survey data for Southern Ocean mesopelagic fishes. Data holders contributed 17,491 occurrence and 11,190 abundance records from 4780 net hauls from 72 different research cruises. Data span across 37 years from 1991 to 2019 and include trait-based information (length, weight, maturity). The final dataset underwent quality control processes and detailed metadata was provided for each sampling event. This dataset can be accessed through Zenodo. <jats:italic>Myctobase<\/jats:italic> will enhance research capacity by providing the broadscale baseline data necessary for observing and modelling mesopelagic fishes.<\/jats:p>",

This high primary productivity, boosted by iron supply from coastal glaciers, attracts organisms from all trophic levels to form a rich and diverse community. How the ecological benefit of polynya productivity is translated to the highest trophic levels remains poorly resolved. We studied 119 southern elephant seals feeding over the Antarctic shelf and demonstrated that: (i) 96% of seals foraging here used polynyas, with individuals spending on average 62% of their time there; (ii) the seals exhibited more area-restricted search behaviour when in polynyas; and (iii) these seals gained more energy (indicated by increased buoyancy from greater fat stores) when inside polynyas. This higher-quality foraging existed even when ice was not present in the study area, indicating that these are important and predictable foraging grounds year-round. Despite these energetic advantages from using polynyas, not all the seals used them extensively. Factors other than food supply may influence an individual's choice in their use of feeding grounds, such as exposure to predation or the probability of being able to return to distant sub-Antarctic breeding sites.<\/jats:p>",

We conducted a systematic review of the effects of climate change (prolonged, directional change) and climate variability on seabirds and marine mammals. We extracted data from 484 studies (4808 published studies were reviewed), comprising 2215 observations on demography, phenology, distribution, diet, behaviour, body condition and physiology. The likelihood of concluding that climate change had an impact increased with study duration. However, the temporal thresholds for the effects of climate change to be discernibly varied from 10 to 29 years depending on the species, the biological response and the oceanic study region. Species with narrow thermal ranges and relatively long generation times were more often reported to be affected by climate change. This provides an important framework for future assessments, with guidance on response‐ and region‐specific temporal dimensions that need to be considered when reporting effects of climate change. Finally, we found that tropical regions and non‐breeding life stages were poorly covered in the literature, a concern that should be addressed to enable a better understanding of the vulnerability of marine predators to climate change.<\/jats:p>",

Differences in habitat selection among individuals may arise from several intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and yet, their interaction has been given little attention in the study of wild populations. We combine sex, body size, and boldness to explain individual differences in the seasonal foraging habitat selection of southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) from the Kerguelen Archipelago. We hypothesize that habitat selection is linked to the trade‐off between resource acquisition and risk, and that individuals differ in their position along this trade‐off because of differences in reproductive strategies, life stages, and metabolic requirements. Before the post‐molt foraging trip, we used a novel object approach test to quantify the boldness of 28 subadult and adult females and 42 subadult males and equipped them with data loggers to track their movements at sea. Subadult males selected neritic and oceanic habitats, whereas females mostly selected less productive oceanic habitats. Both sexes showed a seasonal shift from Antarctic habitats in the south in the summer to the free of ice subantarctic and subtropical habitats in the north in the winter. Males avoided oceanic habitats and selected more productive neritic and Antarctic habitats with body size mostly in the winter. Bolder males selected northern warmer waters in winter, while shyer ones selected the Kerguelen plateau and southern colder oceanic waters. Bolder females selected the Kerguelen plateau in the summer when prey profitability is assumed to be the highest. This study not only provides new insights into the spatiotemporal foraging ecology of elephant seals in relation to personality but also emphasizes the relevance of combining several intrinsic and extrinsic factors in understanding among‐individual variation in space use essential in wildlife management and conservation.<\/jats:p>",

Dense Shelf Water (DSW) formation in MP shows large spatial variability that is related to the (a) local bathymetry, (b) water column preconditioning from the presence/absence of different water masses, and (c) proximity to the Amery Ice Shelf meltwater outflow. MP exhibits sustained sea ice production and brine rejection (thus, salinity increase) from April to October. However, new DSW is only formed from June onward, when the mixed layer deepens and convection is strong enough to break the stratification set by Antarctic Surface Water above and Ice Shelf Water below. We found no evidence of DSW export from MP to Darnley polynya, as previously suggested. Rather, our observations suggest some DSW formed in Darnley Polynya may drain toward the western Prydz Bay. Then, DSW is exported offshore from Prydz Bay through the Prydz Channel. The interplay between sea ice formation, meltwater input, and sea floor topography is likely to explain why some coastal polynyas form more DSW than others, as well as the temporal variability in DSW formation within a particular polynya.<\/jats:p>",

Changes in the demography of predator populations are indicators of broader shifts in food web structure, but long‐term data are required to study these effects. Southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) from Macquarie Island have consistently decreased in population size while all other major populations across the Southern Ocean have recently stabilized or are increasing. Two long‐term mark‐recapture studies (1956–1967 and 1993–2009) have monitored this population, which provides an opportunity to investigate demographic performance over a range of climatic conditions. Using a 9‐state matrix population model, we estimated climate influences on female survival by incorporating two major climatic indices into our model: The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI). Our best model included a 1 year lagged effect of SAM and an unlagged SOI as covariates. A positive relationship with SAM1 (lagged) related the previous year's SAM with juvenile survival, potentially due to changes in local prey availability surrounding Macquarie Island. The unlagged SOI had a negative effect on both juvenile and adult seals, indicating that sea ice dynamics and access to foraging grounds on the East Antarctic continental shelf could explain the different contributions of ENSO events on the survival of females in this population.<\/jats:p>",

While the Weddell and Ross Seas are recognized as key sites for AABW production, additional sources have been discovered in coastal polynya regions around East Antarctica, most recently at Vincennes Bay. Vincennes Bay, despite encompassing two distinct polynya regions, is considered the weakest source, producing Dense Shelf Water (DSW) only just dense enough to contribute to the lighter density classes of AABW found offshore. Here we provide the first detailed oceanographic observations of the continental shelf in Vincennes Bay (104‐111°E), using CTD data from instrumented elephant seals spanning from February to November of 2012. We find that Vincennes Bay has East Antarctica’s warmest recorded intrusions of modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) and that warm mCDW drives basal melt under Vanderford and Underwood ice shelves. Our study also provides the first direct observational evidence for the inflow of meltwater to this region, which increases stratification and hinders DSW formation, and thus AABW production. The Vincennes Bay glaciers, together with the Totten Glacier, drain part of the Aurora Basin, which holds up to 7 m of sea level rise equivalent. Our results highlight the vulnerability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet to intrusions of mCDW.<\/jats:p>",

Events such as marine heatwaves result in an anomalous change in the physical environment, which can lead to shifts in the structure, biomass, and distribution of lower trophic levels. As central‐place foragers, seabirds are vulnerable to changes in their foraging grounds during the breeding season. We first quantified spatiotemporal variability in the occurrence and biomass of prey in response to an abrupt change in oceanography as a result of a marine heatwave event. Secondly, using multivariate techniques and machine learning, we investigated if differences in the foraging technique and prey of seabirds resulted in varying responses to changes in prey occurrence and the environment over a 2.5‐yr period. We found that the main variables correlated with seabird distribution were also important in structuring the occurrence and biomass of prey; sea‐surface temperature (SST), current speed, mixed‐layer depth, and bathymetry. Both zooplankton biomass and the occurrence of fish schools exhibited negative relationships with temperature, and temperature was subsequently an important variable in determining seabird distribution. We were able to establish correlations between the distribution of prey and the spatiotemporal distribution of albatross, little penguins and common‐diving petrels. We were unable to find a correlation between the distribution of prey and that of short‐tailed shearwaters and fairy prions. For high‐use coastal areas, the delineation of important foraging regions is essential to balance human use of an area with the needs of marine predators, particularly seabirds.<\/jats:p>",

Toward understanding krill's response to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg production, with predation pressure post‐spawning, to predict regions of high‐quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all predicted high‐quality spawning habitat. Small‐scale management units (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high‐quality spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.<\/jats:p>",

Specializations arise from the consistent exploitation of a narrow behavioral, spatial or dietary niche over time, which may reduce intraspecific competition and influence adaptability to environmental change. However, few studies have investigated whether behavioral consistency confers benefits at the individual and/or population level. While still recovering from commercial sealing overexploitation, Australian fur seals (AUFS; <jats:italic>Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus<\/jats:italic>) represent the largest marine predator biomass in south‐eastern Australia. During lactation, female AUFS adopt a central‐place foraging strategy and are, thus, vulnerable to changes in prey availability. The present study investigated the population‐level repeatability and individual consistency in foraging behavior of 34 lactating female AUFS at a south‐east Australian breeding colony between 2006 and 2019. Additionally, the influence of individual‐level behavioral consistency on indices of foraging success and efficiency during benthic diving was determined. Low to moderate population‐level repeatability was observed across foraging behaviors, with the greatest repeatability in the mean bearing and modal dive depth. Individual‐level consistency was greatest for the proportion of benthic diving, total distance travelled, and trip duration. Indices of benthic foraging success and efficiency were positively influenced by consistency in the proportion of benthic diving, trip duration and dive rate but not influenced by consistency in bearing to most distal point, dive depth or foraging site fidelity. The results of the present study provide evidence of the benefits of consistency for individuals, which may have flow‐on effects at the population level.<\/jats:p>",

However, in sexually dimorphic species it is difficult to discern if partitioning is due to competition or the different resource needs of morphologically distinct individuals. In the highly dimorphic southern elephant seal, there are intersexual differences in habitat use; at Iles Kerguelen, males predominantly use shelf waters, while females use deeper oceanic waters. There are equally marked intrasexual differences, with some males using the nearby Kerguelen Plateau, and others using the much more distant Antarctic continental shelf (~2,000 km away). We used this combination of inter and intrasexual behavior to test two hypotheses regarding habitat partitioning in highly dimorphic species. (a) that intersexual differences in habitat use will not appear until the seals diverge in body size and (b) that some habitats have higher rates of energy return than others. In particular, that the Antarctic shelf would provide higher energy returns than the Kerguelen Shelf, to offset the greater cost of travel. We quantified the habitat use of 187 southern elephant seals (102 adult females and 85 subadult males). The seals in the two groups were the same size (~2.4 m) removing the confounding effect of body size. We found that the intersexual differences in habitat use existed before the divergence in body size. Also, we found that the amount of energy gained was the same in all of the major habitats. This suggests that the use of shelf habitats by males is innate, and a trade‐off between the need to access the large benthic prey available on shelf waters, against the higher risk of predation there. Intrasexual differences in habitat use are another trade‐off; although there are fewer predators on the Antarctic shelf, it is subject to considerable interannual fluctuations in sea‐ice extent. In contrast, the Kerguelen Plateau presents more consistent foraging opportunities, but contains higher levels of predation. Habitat partitioning in this highly dimorphic species is therefore the result of complex interplay of life history strategies, environmental conditions and predation pressure.<\/jats:p>",

To understand the consequences of marine debris to wildlife populations, studies must go beyond reporting the incidence of wildlife and debris interactions and aim to quantify the harm resulting from these interactions. Tubenosed seabirds are globally threatened, with a near universal risk of debris ingestion and an unquantified risk of mortality due to eating plastics. In this paper, we explore the mortality risk narrative due to the acute effects of debris ingestion, and quantify behavioural and ecological factors including age, diet and foraging method. We examined ingested debris loads, types and mortality of 972 adult and immature seabirds across 17 albatross, shearwater and prion species in a global seabird biodiversity hotspot. Though age and foraging method interact to influence the incidence and number of items ingested, age and diet were the most important factors influencing mortality. Mortality is influenced by debris load and type of debris ingested and there is selectivity for items that visually resemble a seabird’s prey. Immature birds that forage on cephalopods are more likely to ingest and die from eating debris than are adults. Conversely, the risk of death to seabirds that forage on crustaceans is linked to the number of plastic items ingested and is higher in adults. Debris ingestion is an under-recognised cause of tubenose mortality and is likely negatively affecting rare and threatened species.<\/jats:p>",

For oceanic predators, this means foraging behaviour is influenced by processes shaping the distribution of prey. However, oceanic prey is difficult to observe and its abundance and distribution is regionally generalised. We use a spatiotemporally resolved simulation model to describe mid‐trophic prey distribution within the Southern Ocean and demonstrate insights that this modelled prey field provides into the foraging behaviour of a widely distributed marine predator, the southern elephant seal.<\/jats:p><jats:p>From a five‐year simulation of prey biomass, we computed climatologies of mean prey biomass (average prey conditions) and prey biomass variability (meso‐scale variability). We also compiled spatially gridded metrics of seal density and diving behaviour from 13 yr of tracking data. We statistically modelled these metrics as non‐linear functions of prey biomass (both mean and variability) and used these to predict seal distribution and behaviour. Our predictions were consistent with observations (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>adj<\/jats:sub> = 0.23), indicating that seals aggregate in regions of high mesoscale activity where eddies concentrate prey. Here, seals dived deeper (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.12, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.51) and spent less time hunting (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.05, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.56), likely targeting deep but profitable prey patches. Seals generally avoided areas of low eddy activity where prey was likely dispersed. Most seals foraged south of the Subantarctic Front, despite north of the front exhibiting consistently high simulated prey biomasses. This likely reflects seal prey or habitat preferences, but also emphasises the importance of mesoscale prey biomass variability relative to regionally high mean biomass. This work demonstrates the value of coupling mechanistic representations of prey biomass with predator observations to provide insight into how biophysical processes combine to shape species distributions. This will be increasingly important for the robust prediction of species’ responses to rapid system change.<\/jats:p>",

Determining how native island populations respond demographically to invasive species can provide information to mitigate the negative effects of invasive species. Using 20 years of mark-recapture data from three sympatric species of albatrosses (black-browed<jats:italic>Thalassarche melanophris<\/jats:italic>, grey-headed<jats:italic>T. chrysostoma<\/jats:italic>, and light-mantled albatrosses<jats:italic>Phoebetria palpebrata<\/jats:italic>), we quantified the influence of invasive European rabbits<jats:italic>Oryctolagus cuniculus<\/jats:italic>and extreme weather patterns on breeding probability and success. Temporal variability in rabbit density explained 33–76% of the variability in breeding probability for all three species, with severe decreases in breeding probability observed after a lag period following highest rabbit numbers. For black-browed albatrosses, the combination of extreme rainfall and high rabbit density explained 33% of total trait variability and dramatically reduced breeding success. We showed that invasive rabbits and extreme weather events reduce reproductive output in albatrosses and that eliminating rabbits had a positive effect on albatross reproduction. This illustrates how active animal management at a local breeding site can result in positive population outcomes even for wide ranging animals like albatrosses where influencing vital rates during their at-sea migrations is more challenging.<\/jats:p>",

Their spatio-temporal distribution is however, difficult to map across remote regions particularly the vast Southern Ocean. This represents a key gap in understanding biogeochemical processes, marine ecosystem structure, and how changing ocean conditions will affect marine predators, which depend upon mesopelagic prey. We infer mesopelagic prey vertical distribution and relative abundance in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (20° to 130°E) with a novel approach using predator-derived indices. Fourteen years of southern elephant seal tracking and dive data, from the open ocean between the Antarctic Polar Front and the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front, clearly show that the vertical distribution of mesopelagic prey is influenced by the physical hydrographic processes that structure their habitat. Mesopelagic prey have a more restricted vertical migration and higher relative abundance closer to the surface where Circumpolar Deep Water rises to shallower depths. Combining these observations with a future projection of Southern Ocean conditions we show that changes in the coupling of surface and deep waters will potentially redistribute mesopelagic prey. These changes are small overall, but show important spatial variability: prey will increase in relative abundance to the east of the Kerguelen Plateau but decrease to the west. The consequences for deep-diving specialists such as elephant seals and whales over this time scale will likely be minor, but the changes in mesoscale vertical energy flow have implications for predators that forage within the mesopelagic zone as well as the broader pelagic ecosystem.<\/jats:p>",

Individuals are expected to adjust their foraging movements to the hierarchical spatial distribution of resources. At a small local scale, spatial segregation in foraging habitat happens among individuals of closely situated colonies. If foraging segregation is due to differences in distribution of resources, we would expect segregated foraging areas to have divergent habitat characteristics.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We investigated how environmental characteristics of preferred foraging areas differ between two closely situated Subantarctic fur seal (<jats:italic>Arctocephalus tropicalis<\/jats:italic>) colonies and a single Antarctic fur seal (<jats:italic>A. gazella<\/jats:italic>) colony that forage in different pelagic areas even though they are located well within each other’s foraging range. We further investigated the influence of the seasonal cycle on those environmental factors. This study used tracking data from 121 adult female Subantarctic and Antarctic fur seals, collected during summer and winter (2009–2015), from three different colonies. Boosted Regression Tree species distribution models were used to determine key environmental variables associated with areas of fur seal restricted search behaviour. There were no differences in the relative influence of key environmental variables between colonies and seasons. The variables with the most influence for each colony and season were latitude, longitude and magnitude of sea-currents. The influence of latitude and longitude is a by-product of the species’ distinct foraging areas, despite the close proximity (&lt; 25 km) of the colonies. The predicted potential foraging areas for each colony changed from summer to winter, reflecting the seasonal cycle of the Southern Ocean. The model predicted that the potential foraging areas of females from the three colonies should overlap, and the fact they do not in reality indicates that factors other than environmental are influencing the location of each colony’s foraging area.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The results indicated that small scale spatial segregation of foraging habitats is not driven by bottom-up processes. It is therefore important to also consider other potential drivers, e.g. competition, information transfer, and memory, to understand animal foraging decisions and movements.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>",

While traditional approaches to such analysis mostly focus on predicting animal states during movement, we describe an approach that allows us to identify representative movement patterns of different animal groups. To do this, we propose a carefully designed recurrent neural network and combine it with telemetry data for automatic feature extraction and identification of non-predefined representative patterns. In the experiment, we consider a particular marine predator species, the southern elephant seal, as an example. With our approach, we identify that the male seals in our data set share similar movement patterns when they are close to land. We identify this pattern recurring in a number of distant locations, consistent with alternative approaches from previous research.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Foraging behaviour of marine predators inferred from the analysis of horizontal or vertical movements commonly lack quantitative information about foraging success. Several marine mammal species are known to perform dives where they passively drift in the water column, termed “drift” dives. The drift rate is determined by the animal’s buoyancy, which can be used to make inference regarding body condition. Long term dive records retrieved via satellite uplink are often summarized before transmission. This loss of resolution hampers identification of drift dives. Here, we develop a flexible, hierarchically structured approach to identify drift dives and estimate the drift rate from the summarized time-depth profiles that are increasingly available to the global research community. Based on high-resolution dive data from southern elephant seals, we classify dives as drift/non-drift and apply a summarization algorithm. We then (i) automatically generate dive groups based on inflection point ordering using a ‘Reverse’ Broken-Stick Algorithm, (ii) develop a set of threshold criteria to apply across groups, ensuring non-drift dives are most efficiently rejected, and (iii) finally implement a custom Kalman filter to retain the remaining dives that are within the seals estimated drifting time series. Validation with independent data sets shows our method retains approximately 3% of all dives, of which 88% are true drift dives. The drift rate estimates are unbiased, with the upper 95% quantile of the mean squared error between the daily averaged summarized profiles using our method (SDDR) and the observed daily averaged drift rate (ODDR) being only 0.0015. The trend of the drifting time-series match expectations for capital breeders, showing the lowest body condition commencing foraging trips and a progressive improvement as they remain at sea. Our method offers sufficient resolution to track small changes in body condition at a fine temporal scale. This approach overcomes a long-term challenge for large existing and ongoing data collections, with potential application across other drift diving species. Enabling robust identification of foraging success at sea offers a rare and valuable opportunity for monitoring marine ecosystem productivity in space and time by tracking the success of a top predator.<\/jats:p>",

Marine debris ingestion is a globally recognized threat to marine biodiversity, yet the relationship between how much debris a bird ingests and mortality remains poorly understood. Using cause of death data from 1733 seabirds of 51 species, we demonstrate a significant relationship between ingested debris and a debris-ingestion cause of death (dose-response). There is a 20.4% chance of lifetime mortality from ingesting a single debris item, rising to 100% after consuming 93 items. Obstruction of the gastro-intestinal tract is the leading cause of death. Overall, balloons are the highest-risk debris item; 32 times more likely to result in death than ingesting hard plastic. These findings have significant implications for quantifying seabird mortality due to debris ingestion, and provide identifiable policy targets aimed to reduce mortality for threatened species worldwide.<\/jats:p>",

The extent, trends and underlying mechanisms driving these interactions remain poorly known. Using long-term (2003–2017) datasets from seven major Patagonian toothfish (<jats:italic>Dissostichus eleginoides<\/jats:italic>) longline fisheries, this study assessed the levels and inter-annual trends of sperm whale (<jats:italic>Physeter macrocephalus<\/jats:italic>) and/or killer whale (<jats:italic>Orcinus orca<\/jats:italic>) interactions as proportions of fishing time (days) and fishing area (spatial cells). The role of fishing patterns in explaining between-fisheries variations of probabilities of odontocete interactions was investigated. While interaction levels remained globally stable since the early 2000s, they varied greatly between fisheries from 0 to &gt;50% of the fishing days and area. Interaction probabilities were influenced by the seasonal concentration of fishing effort, size of fishing areas, density of vessels, their mobility and the depth at which they operated. The results suggest that between-fisheries variations of interaction probabilities are largely explained by the extent to which vessels provide whales with opportunities for interactions. Determining the natural distribution of whales will, therefore, allow fishers to implement better strategies of spatio-temporal avoidance of depredation.<\/jats:p>",

We examined the incidence and ecological factors associated with marine debris ingestion in Procellariiformes by examining seabirds collected at a global seabird hotspot, the Australasian - Southern Ocean boundary. We examined marine debris ingestion trends in 1734 individuals of 51 Procellariform species, finding significant variation in the incidence of marine debris abundance among species. Variation in the incidence of marine debris ingestion between species was influenced by the taxonomy, foraging ecology, diet, and foraging range overlaps with oceanic regions polluted with marine debris. Among the ecological drivers of marine debris ingestion variability in Procellariiformes, we demonstrate that the combination of taxonomy, foraging method, diet, and exposure to marine debris are the most important determinants of incidence of ingestion. We use these results to develop a global forecast for Procellariiform taxa at the risk of highest incidence of marine debris ingestion. We find seabirds that forage at the surface; especially by surface seizing, diving and filtering, those with a crustacean dominant diet, and those that forage in or near marine debris hotspots are at highest risk of debris ingestion. We predict that family with the highest risk are the storm petrels (<jats:italic>Hydrobatidae<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Oceanitidae<\/jats:italic>). We demonstrate that the greater the exposure of high-risk groups to marine debris while foraging, the greater the incidence and number of marine debris items will be ingested.<\/jats:p>",

This fundamentally limits access by researchers to critical parts of pinniped life history and has spurred the development and implementation of a variety of externally attached telemetry devices (ETDs) to collect information about movement patterns, physiology and ecology of marine animals when they cannot be directly observed. ETDs are less invasive and easier to apply than implanted internal devices, making them more widely used. However, ETDs have limited retention times and their use may result in negative short- and long-term consequences including capture myopathy, impacts to energetics, behavior, and entanglement risk. We identify 15 best practice recommendations for the use of ETDs with pinnipeds that address experimental justification, animal capture, tag design, tag attachment, effects assessments, preparation, and reporting. Continued improvement of best practices is critical within the framework of the Three Rs (Reduction, Refinement, Replacement); these best practice recommendations provide current guidance to mitigate known potential negative outcomes for individuals and local populations. These recommendations were developed specifically for pinnipeds; however, they may also be applicable to studies of other marine taxa. We conclude with four desired future directions for the use of ETDs in technology development, validation studies, experimental designs and data sharing.<\/jats:p>",

These seals migrate up to 4,000 km from their breeding colonies, foraging for months in a variety of Southern Ocean habitats. Understanding how movement patterns vary with environmental features and how these relationships differ among individuals employing different foraging strategies can provide insight into foraging performance at a population level. We apply new fast‐estimation tools to fit mixed effects within a random walk movement model, rapidly inferring among‐individual variability in southern elephant seal environment–movement relationships. We found that seals making foraging trips to the sea ice on or near the Antarctic continental shelf consistently reduced speed and directionality (move persistence) with increasing sea‐ice coverage but had variable responses to chlorophyll <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentration, whereas seals foraging in the open ocean reduced move persistence in regions where circumpolar deep water shoaled. Given future climate scenarios, open‐ocean foragers may encounter more productive habitat but sea‐ice foragers may see reduced habitat availability. Our approach is scalable to large telemetry data sets and allows flexible combinations of mixed effects to be evaluated via model selection, thereby illuminating the ecological context of animal movements that underlie habitat usage.<\/jats:p>",

Age is strongly related to individual physiological condition, reproductive potential and mortality rate. Currently, there are no robust molecular methods for age estimation in birds. Instead, individuals must be ringed as chicks to establish known‐age populations, which is a labour‐intensive and expensive process. The estimation of chronological age using DNA methylation (DNAm) is emerging as a robust approach in mammals including humans, mice and some non‐model species. Here, we quantified DNAm in whole blood samples from a total of 71 known‐age Short‐tailed shearwaters (<jats:italic>Ardenna tenuirostris<\/jats:italic>) using digital restriction enzyme analysis of methylation (DREAM). The DREAM method measures DNAm levels at thousands of CpG dinucleotides throughout the genome. We identified seven CpG sites with DNAm levels that correlated with age. A model based on these relationships estimated age with a mean difference of 2.8 years to known age, based on validation estimates from models created by repeated sampling of training and validation data subsets. Longitudinal observation of individuals re‐sampled over 1 or 2 years generally showed an increase in estimated age (6/7 cases). For the first time, we have shown that epigenetic changes with age can be detected in a wild bird. This approach should be of broad interest to researchers studying age biomarkers in non‐model species and will allow identification of markers that can be assessed using targeted techniques for accurate age estimation in large population studies.<\/jats:p>",

During their post-moult trips from Isles Kerguelen to the Antarctic continental shelf, a total of 18 out of 23 seals visited 9 different polynyas, spending on average 25 ± 20% (up to 75%) of their total trip time inside polynyas. Changes in seal foraging and diving behaviours are observed inside polynyas as compared to outside polynyas. Two polynya usages by seals are observed for the inactive and active polynya phases, pointing to different seasonal peaks in prey abundance. During the active polynya phase, we link seal foraging behaviour to changes in the physical stability of the water-column, which likely impact the seasonal biological dynamics within polynyas.<\/jats:p>",

We found that movement patterns of marine megafauna are mostly independent of their evolutionary histories, differing significantly from patterns for terrestrial animals. We detected a remarkable convergence in the distribution of speed and turning angles across organisms ranging from whales to turtles (epitome for the slowest animals on land but not at sea). Marine megafauna show a prevalence of movement patterns dominated by search behavior in coastal habitats compared with more directed, ballistic movement patterns when the animals move across the open ocean. The habitats through which they move will therefore need to be considered for effective conservation.<\/jats:p>",

However, there are reports of neonates further south, suggesting that the calving areas may be poorly defined. During aerial photogrammetric research in 2013 and 2015, we sighted large numbers of humpback whale calves along North West Cape (21°47′–22°43′S). We estimated the minimum relative calf abundance to be 463–603 in 2013 and 557–725 in 2015. We categorized the calves as either neonate or post neonate according to their color and size. The majority of calves sighted in both years (85% in 2013; 94% in 2015) were neonates. Our observations indicate that a minimum of approximately 20% (17.1%–24.3%) of the expected number of calves of this population are born near, or south of, North West Cape. We thus demonstrate that the calving grounds for the Breeding Stock D population extend south from Camden Sound in the Kimberley (15°S) to at least North West Cape (22°43′S), 1,000 km southwest of the currently recognized calving area.<\/jats:p>",

The Southern Ocean supports large populations of seabirds and marine mammals and is undergoing rapid environmental change. The management and conservation of these predators and their environment relies on understanding their distribution and its link with the biophysical environment, as the latter determines the distribution and abundance of prey.

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past five decades, marine mammal interactions with fisheries have become a major human-wildlife conflict globally. The emergence of longline fishing is concomitant with the development of depredation-type interactions i.e., marine mammals feeding on fish caught on hooks. The killer whale (<jats:italic>Orcinus orca<\/jats:italic>) is one of the species most involved in depredation on longline fisheries. The issue was first reported in high latitudes but, with increasing expansion of this fishing method, other fisheries have begun to experience interactions. The present study investigated killer whale interactions with two geographically isolated blue-eye trevalla (<jats:italic>Hyperoglyphe antarctica<\/jats:italic>) fisheries operating in temperate waters off Amsterdam/St. Paul Islands (Indian Ocean) and south-eastern Australia. These two fisheries differ in the fishing technique used (vertical<jats:italic>vs.<\/jats:italic>demersal longlines), effort, catch, fleet size and fishing area size. Using 7-year (2010–16) long fishing and observation datasets, this study estimated the levels of killer whale interactions and examined the influence of spatio-temporal and operational variables on the probability of vessels to experience interactions. Killer whales interactions occurred during 58.4% and 21.2% of all fishing days, and over 94% and 47.4% of the fishing area for both fisheries, respectively. In south-eastern Australia, the probability of occurrence of killer whale interactions during fishing days varied seasonally with a decrease in spring, increased with the daily fishing effort and decreased with the distance travelled by the vessel between fishing days. In Amsterdam/St. Paul, this probability was only influenced by latitude, with an increase in the southern part of the area. Together, these findings document two previously unreported cases of high killer whale depredation, and provide insights on ways to avoid the issue. The study also emphasizes the need to further examine the local characteristics of fisheries and the ecology of local depredating killer whale populations in as important drivers of depredation.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Open ocean predator‐prey interactions are often difficult to interpret because of a lack of information on prey fields at scales relevant to predator behaviour. Hence, there is strong interest in identifying the biological and physical factors influencing the distribution and abundance of prey species, which may be of broad predictive use for conservation planning and evaluating effects of environmental change. This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill <jats:italic>Euphausia superba<\/jats:italic>, using acoustic observations of individual swarms (aggregations) from a large‐scale survey off East Antarctica. We developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope, but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter models to generate regional‐scale spatial predictions using a 10‐yr remotely‐sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were consistently predicted during austral mid‐summers, which may underpin key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies, illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to other krill‐dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern Ocean and beyond.<\/jats:p>",

The same applies at Marion Island where a substantial proportion of the world population breeds. In spite of their obvious ecological importance, the at‐sea distribution and behavior of this population has until recently remained entirely unknown. In addressing this information deficiency, we deployed satellite‐linked tracking instruments on 15 adult king penguins over 2 years, April 2008 and 2013, to study their post‐guard foraging distribution and habitat preferences. Uniquely among adult king penguins, individuals by and large headed out against the prevailing Antarctic Circumpolar Current, foraging to the west and southwest of the island. On average, individuals ventured a maximum distance of 1,600 km from the colony, with three individuals foraging close to, or beyond, 3,500 km west of the colony. Birds were mostly foraging south of the Antarctic Polar Front and north of the southern boundary of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Habitat preferences were assessed using boosted regression tree models which indicated sea surface temperate, depth, and chorophyll a concentration to be the most important predictors of habitat selection. Interestingly, king penguins rapidly transited the eddy‐rich area to the west of Marion Island, associated with the Southwest Indian Ocean Ridge, which has been shown to be important for foraging in other marine top predators. In accordance with this, the king penguins generally avoided areas with high eddy kinetic energy. The results from this first study into the behavioral ecology and at‐sea distribution of king penguins at Marion Island contribute to our broader understanding of this species.<\/jats:p>",

We used analytical approaches, developed to cope with “big data”, that require no ‘<jats:italic>a priori’<\/jats:italic> assumptions about the behaviour of the target agents, to analyse a pooled tracking dataset of 272 elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) in the Southern Ocean, that was comprised of &gt;500,000 location estimates collected over more than a decade. Our analyses showed that the displacements of these seals were described by a truncated power law distribution across several spatial and temporal scales, with a clear signature of directed movement. This pattern was evident when analysing the aggregated tracks despite a wide diversity of individual trajectories. We also identified marine provinces that described the migratory and foraging habitats of these seals. Our analysis provides evidence for the presence of intrinsic drivers of movement, such as memory, that cannot be detected using common models of movement behaviour. These results highlight the potential for “big data” techniques to provide new insights into movement behaviour when applied to large datasets of animal tracking.<\/jats:p>",

However, how Weddell seals find food in the winter months remains poorly documented. We equipped adult Weddell seals after their annual molt with satellite‐relayed data loggers at two sites in East Antarctica: Dumont D'Urville (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 12, <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DDU<\/jats:styled-content>) and Davis (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 20). We used binomial generalized mixed‐effect models to investigate Weddell seals’ behavioral response (i.e., “hunting” vs. “transit”) to physical aspects of their environment (e.g., ice concentration). Weddell seal foraging was concentrated to within 5 km of a breathing hole, and they appear to move between holes as local food is depleted. There were regional differences in behavior so that seals at Davis traveled greater distances (three times more) and spent less time in hunting mode (half the time) than seals at <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DDU<\/jats:styled-content>. Despite these differences, hunting dives at both locations were pelagic, concentrated in areas of high ice concentration, and over areas of complex bathymetry. There was also a seasonal change in diving behavior from transiting early in the season to more hunting during winter. Our observations suggest that Weddell seal foraging behavior is plastic and that they respond behaviorally to changes in their environment to maximize food acquisition and storage. Such plasticity is a hallmark of animals that live in very dynamic environments such as the high Antarctic where resources are unpredictable.<\/jats:p>",

We use species habitat models to predict the winter foraging habitats of female southern elephant seals and investigate how changes in environmental variables within these habitats may be related to observed decreases in the Macquarie Island population. There were three main groups of seals that specialized in different ocean realms (the sub‐Antarctic, the Ross Sea and the Victoria Land Coast). The physical and climate attributes (e.g. wind strength, sea surface height, ocean current strength) varied amongst the realms and also displayed different temporal trends over the last two to four decades. Most notably, sea ice extent increased on average in the Victoria Land realm while it decreased overall in the Ross Sea realm. Using a species distribution model relating mean residence times (time spent in each 50 × 50 km grid cell) to 9 climate and physical co‐variates, we developed spatial predictions of residence time to identify the core regions used by the seals across the Southern Ocean from 120°E to 120°W. Population size at Macquarie Island was negatively correlated with ice concentration within the core habitat of seals using the Victoria Land Coast and the Ross Sea. Sea ice extent and concentration is predicted to continue to change in the Southern Ocean, having unknown consequences for the biota of the region. The proportion of Macquarie Island females (40%) utilizing the relatively stable sub‐Antarctic region, may buffer this population against longer‐term regional changes in habitat quality, but the Macquarie Island population has persistently decreased (−1.45% per annum) over seven decades indicating that environmental changes in the Antarctic are acting on the remaining 60% of the population to impose a long‐term population decline in a top Southern Ocean predator.<\/jats:p>",

Using a unique set of historical whaling records from Western Australia (1952–1963), we investigated energy stores of large cetaceans with differing life histories, and quantified the relationship between total body lipid and length for humpback whales (<jats:italic>Megaptera novaeangliae)<\/jats:italic>(<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 905) and sperm whales<jats:italic>(Physeter macrocephalus)<\/jats:italic>(<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 1961). We found that total body lipid increased with body length in both humpback and sperm whales, consistent with size-related energy stores. Male humpback whales stored 2.49 kl (15.6 barrels) (31.9–74.9%) more lipid than male sperm whales of equivalent length, to fuel their annual migration. Relative lipid stores of sperm whales (males) were constant throughout the year, while those of humpback whales varied with reproductive class and sampling date. Pregnant female humpback whales had higher relative energy stores than non-pregnant females and males (26.2% and 37.4%, respectively), to fuel the energy demands of gestation and lactation. Those that reached the sampling site later (<jats:italic>en route<\/jats:italic>to their breeding grounds) carried higher lipid stores than those that arrived earlier, possibly reflecting individual variation in residency times in the Antarctic feeding grounds. Importantly, longer pregnant females had relatively larger energy stores than the shorter pregnant females, indicating that the smaller individuals may experience higher levels of energetic stress during the migration fast. The relationships we developed between body lipid and length can be used to inform bioenergetics and ecosystem models when such detailed information is not available.<\/jats:p>",

Quantifying how Antarctic predators respond to such changes provides the context for predicting how climate variability/change will affect these assemblages into the future. Over an 11-year time-series, we examine how inter-annual variability in sea ice concentration and advance affect the foraging behaviour of a top Antarctic predator, the southern elephant seal. Females foraged longer in pack ice in years with greatest sea ice concentration and earliest sea ice advance, while males foraged longer in polynyas in years of lowest sea ice concentration. There was a positive relationship between near-surface meridional wind anomalies and female foraging effort, but not for males. This study reveals the complexities of foraging responses to climate forcing by a poleward migratory predator through varying sea ice property and dynamic anomalies.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>In the Southern Ocean, wide‐ranging predators offer the opportunity to quantify how animals respond to differences in the environment because their behavior and population trends are an integrated signal of prevailing conditions within multiple marine habitats. Southern elephant seals in particular, can provide useful insights due to their circumpolar distribution, their long and distant migrations and their performance of extended bouts of deep diving. Furthermore, across their range, elephant seal populations have very different population trends. In this study, we present a data set from the International Polar Year project; Marine Mammals Exploring the Oceans Pole to Pole for southern elephant seals, in which a large number of instruments (<jats:italic>N<\/jats:italic> = 287) deployed on animals, encompassing a broad circum‐Antarctic geographic extent, collected <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic> ocean data and at‐sea foraging metrics that explicitly link foraging behavior and habitat structure in time and space. Broadly speaking, the seals foraged in two habitats, the relatively shallow waters of the Antarctic continental shelf and the Kerguelen Plateau and deep open water regions. Animals of both sexes were more likely to exhibit area‐restricted search (<jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ARS<\/jats:styled-content>) behavior rather than transit in shelf habitats. While Antarctic shelf waters can be regarded as prime habitat for both sexes, female seals tend to move northwards with the advance of sea ice in the late autumn or early winter. The water masses used by the seals also influenced their behavioral mode, with female <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ARS<\/jats:styled-content> behavior being most likely in modified Circumpolar Deepwater or northerly Modified Shelf Water, both of which tend to be associated with the outer reaches of the Antarctic Continental Shelf. The combined effects of (1) the differing habitat quality, (2) differing responses to encroaching ice as the winter progresses among colonies, (3) differing distances between breeding and haul‐out sites and high quality habitats, and (4) differing long‐term regional trends in sea ice extent can explain the differing population trends observed among elephant seal colonies.<\/jats:p>",

However, these inferences have not been directly validated in the field with video, and it remains unclear if this method can be applied to benthic foraging animals. This study assessed the ability of dive characteristics from time-depth recorders (TDR) to predict attempted prey capture events (APC) that were directly observed on animal-borne video in Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus, n=11). The most parsimonious model predicting the probability of a dive with ≥1 APC on video included only descent rate as a predictor variable. The majority (94%) of the 389 total APC were successful, and the majority of the dives (68%) contained at least one successful APC. The best model predicting these successful dives included descent rate as a predictor. Comparisons of the TDR model predictions to video yielded a maximum accuracy of 77.5% in classifying dives as either APC or non-APC or 77.1% in classifying dives as successful verses unsuccessful. Foraging intensity, measured as either total APC per dive or total successful APC per dive, was best predicted by bottom duration and ascent rate. The accuracy in predicting total APC per dive varied based on the number of APC per dive with maximum accuracy occurring at 1 APC for both total (54%) and only successful APC (52%). Results from this study linking verified foraging dives to dive characteristics potentially opens the door to decades of historical TDR datasets across several otariid species.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Despite being critically endangered, the at-sea behaviour of hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata) remains insufficiently understood to support a global conservation strategy. Habitat location and spatial use are poorly documented, which is particularly true for the globally important Australian hawksbill population. We equipped 10 adult female hawksbill turtles nesting on Groote Eylandt, northern Australia, with Fastloc GPS and Argos satellite transmitters. We quantified fine-scale habitat use and area-restricted search behaviour, and located potential feeding and developmental habitats by simulating hatchling turtle dispersal patterns by using a particle-tracking hydrological model. During the breeding season, females mostly remained near their nesting site. Post-breeding, all turtles migrated to foraging sites on the Australian continental shelf, primarily in the Gulf of Carpentaria in coastal seagrass pastures, but also offshore near coral-reef platforms. The distribution of adult foraging grounds was similar to simulated dispersal patterns of hatchling turtles from distant rookeries, thus highlighting the ecological significance of the Gulf of Carpentaria for hawksbill turtles. Although this hawksbill turtle population is likely to be endemic to Australian waters, national and international conservation initiatives are required to mitigate sources of anthropogenic mortality (e.g. illegal tortoise-shell trade, incidental captures in fishing gear, marine debris, seabed mining exploitation).<\/jats:p>",

Australia supports the largest breeding aggregations worldwide; however, there are no accurate estimates of population abundance and seasonality for hawksbill turtles at important nesting grounds in eastern Arnhem Land.\n\nAims\nThis study was designed to fill in this lack of ecological information and assist with the conservation and management of hawksbill turtles. More specifically, our overarching goals were to assess nesting seasonality, habitat preferences and provide the first estimate of annual nesting population size at a Northern Territory rookery.\n\nMethods\nIn 2009 and 2010 we collected beach monitoring, satellite telemetry and sand temperature data over two nesting seasons at a group of three islands located 30 km off Groote Eylandt in the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia. We subsequently analysed these data to unravel hawksbill nesting behaviour and reproductive outputs, and examined the vulnerability of this rookery to climate change.\n\nKey results\nHawksbill turtle nesting seasonality consistently started in mid-May, peaked in mid-August and ended in late November. Annual nesting abundance showed a near 3-fold increase between 2009 and 2010, with an average of 220 and 580 hawksbill females nesting on this island group respectively. Sand temperature at 50 cm reached more than 30°C at all monitored sites during most of the peak of the incubation period.\n\nConclusions\nThis remote and untouched group of islands constitutes a major hawksbill turtle rookery both nationally and globally. While anthropogenic impacts and predation are low year round, climate change threatens to skew hatchling sex ratios, eventually leading to an increase in hatchling mortality.\n\nImplications\nAdditional ground-based surveys are required to refine the accuracy of population estimates presented in this study. Given the paucity of data in the region, we recommend this island group off Groote Eylandt be used as a population-monitoring index site for the eastern Arnhem Land hawksbill turtle breeding aggregation.\n\n<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Animal movement research relies on biotelemetry, and telemetry‐based locations are increasingly augmented with ancillary information. This presents an underutilized opportunity to enhance movement process models. Given tags designed to record specific behaviors, efforts are increasing to update movement models beyond reliance solely upon horizontal movement information to improve inference of space use and activity budgets. We present two state‐space models adapted to incorporate ancillary data to inform three discrete movement states: directed, resident, and an activity state. These were developed for two case studies: (1) a “haulout” model for Weddell seals, and (2) an “activity” model for Antarctic fur seals which intersperse periods of diving activity and inactivity. The methodology is easily implementable with any ancillary data that can be expressed as a proportion (or binary) indicator. A comparison of the models augmented with ancillary information and unaugmented models confirmed that many behavioral states appeared mischaracterized in the latter. Important changes in subsequent activity budgets occurred. Haulout accounted for 0.17 of the overall Weddell seal time budget, with the estimated proportion of time spent in a resident state reduced from a posterior median of 0.69 (0.65–0.73; 95% <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>) to 0.54 (0.50–0.58 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>). The drop was more dramatic in the Antarctic fur seal case, from 0.57 (0.52–0.63 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>) to 0.22 (0.20–0.25 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>), with 0.35 (0.31–0.39 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>) of time spent in the inactive (nondiving) state. These findings reinforce previously raised contentions about the drawbacks of behavioral states inferred solely from horizontal movements. Our findings have implications for assessing habitat requirements; estimating energetics and consumption; and management efforts such as mitigating fisheries interactions. Combining multiple sources of information within integrated frameworks should improve inference of relationships between movement decisions and fitness, the interplay between resource and habitat dependencies, and their changes at the population and landscape level.<\/jats:p>",

Here we show new observations from CTD-instrumented elephant seals in 2011–2013 that provide the first complete assessment of dense shelf water formation in Prydz Bay. After a complex evolution involving opposing contributions from three polynyas (positive) and two ice shelves (negative), dense shelf water (salinity 34.65–34.7) is exported through Prydz Channel. This provides a distinct, relatively fresh contribution to Cape Darnley bottom water. Elsewhere, dense water formation is hindered by the freshwater input from the Amery and West Ice Shelves into the Prydz Bay Gyre. This study highlights the susceptibility of Antarctic bottom water to increased freshwater input from the enhanced melting of ice shelves, and ultimately the potential collapse of Antarctic bottom water formation in a warming climate.<\/jats:p>",

We used two decades of telemetry data from the East Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean. Habitat utilization models for the spring/summer period were developed for six highly abundant, wide‐ranging meso‐ and top‐predator species: Adélie <jats:italic>Pygoscelis adeliae<\/jats:italic> and emperor <jats:italic>Aptenodytes forsteri<\/jats:italic> penguins, light‐mantled albatross <jats:italic>Phoebetria palpebrata<\/jats:italic>, Antarctic fur seals <jats:italic>Arctocephalus gazella<\/jats:italic>, southern elephant seals <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>, and Weddell seals <jats:italic>Leptonychotes weddellii<\/jats:italic>. The regional predictions from these models were combined to identify areas utilized by multiple species, and therefore likely to be of particular ecological significance. These areas were distributed across the longitudinal breadth of the East Antarctic sector, and were characterized by proximity to breeding colonies, both on the Antarctic continent and on subantarctic islands to the north, and by sea‐ice dynamics, particularly locations of winter polynyas. These areas of important habitat were also congruent with many of the areas reported to be showing the strongest regional trends in sea ice seasonality. The results emphasize the importance of on‐shore and sea‐ice processes to Antarctic marine ecosystems. Our study provides ocean‐basin‐scale predictions of predator habitat utilization, an assessment of contemporary habitat use against which future changes can be assessed, and is of direct relevance to current conservation planning and spatial management efforts.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In animal ecology, a question of key interest for aquatic species is how changes in movement behavior are related in the horizontal and vertical dimensions when individuals forage. Alternative theoretical models and inconsistent empirical findings mean that this question remains unresolved. Here we tested expectations by incorporating the vertical dimension (dive information) when predicting switching between movement states (“resident” or “directed”) within a state‐space model. We integrated telemetry‐based tracking and diving data available for four seal species (southern elephant, Weddell, antarctic fur, and crabeater) in East Antarctica. Where possible, we included dive variables derived from the relationships between (1) dive duration and depth (as a measure of effort), and (2) dive duration and the postdive surface interval (as a physiological measure of cost). Our results varied within and across species, but there was a general tendency for the probability of switching into “resident” state to be positively associated with shorter dive durations (for a given depth) and longer postdive surface intervals (for a given dive duration). Our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that simplistic interpretations of optimal foraging theory based only on horizontal movements do not directly translate into the vertical dimension in dynamic marine environments. Analyses that incorporate at least two dimensions can test more sophisticated models of foraging behavior.<\/jats:p>",

This landmark dataset of around 75,000 temperature and salinity profiles from 20–140 °E, concentrated on the sector between the Kerguelen Islands and Prydz Bay, continues to grow through the coordinated efforts of French and Australian marine research teams. The seal data are quality controlled and calibrated using delayed-mode techniques involving comparisons with other existing profiles as well as cross-comparisons similar to established protocols within the Argo community, with a resulting accuracy of ±0.03 °C in temperature and ±0.05 in salinity or better. The data offer invaluable new insights into the water masses, oceanographic processes and provides a vital tool for oceanographers seeking to advance our understanding of this key component of the global ocean climate.<\/jats:p>",

The age at which individuals first reproduce is an important factor influencing the intensity of potential costs (e.g. reduced survival) involved in the first breeding event. However, quantifying age-related variation in the cost of first reproduction in wild animals remains challenging because of the difficulty in reliably recording the first breeding event. Here, using a multi-event capture–recapture model that accounts for both imperfect detection and uncertainty in the breeding status on an 18-year dataset involving 6637 individuals, we estimated age and state-specific survival of female elephant seals (\n            <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>\n            ) in the declining Macquarie Island population. We detected a clear cost of first reproduction on survival. This cost was higher for both younger first-time breeders and older first-time breeders compared with females recruiting at age four, the overall mean age at first reproduction. Neither earlier primiparity nor delaying primiparity appear to confer any evolutionary advantage, rather the optimal strategy seems to be to start breeding at a single age, 4 years.\n          <\/jats:p>",

The signal appeared in June, 3 months after the onset of active sea‐ice production in the nearby Vincennes Bay Polynya (VBP). The AABW signal continued for about 5 months at two moorings, with 1 month delay at the western site further downstream. Ship‐based hydrographic data are in agreement, detecting the westward spread of new AABW over the continental slope from VBP. On the continental shelf, Dense Shelf Water (DSW) formation is observed by instrumented seals, in and around the VBP during autumn, and we estimate its transport to be 0.16 ± 0.07 (× 10<jats:sup>6<\/jats:sup>m<jats:sup>3<\/jats:sup>s<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>).

This article reviews current and expected changes in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ASO<\/jats:styled-content> physical habitats in response to climate change. It then reviews how these changes may impact the autecology of marine biota of this polar region: microbes, zooplankton, salps, Antarctic krill, fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, seabirds, and benthos. The general prognosis for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ASO<\/jats:styled-content> marine habitats is for an overall warming and freshening, strengthening of westerly winds, with a potential pole‐ward movement of those winds and the frontal systems, and an increase in ocean eddy activity. Many habitat parameters will have regionally specific changes, particularly relating to sea ice characteristics and seasonal dynamics. Lower trophic levels are expected to move south as the ocean conditions in which they are currently found move pole‐ward. For Antarctic krill and finfish, the latitudinal breadth of their range will depend on their tolerance of warming oceans and changes to productivity. Ocean acidification is a concern not only for calcifying organisms but also for crustaceans such as Antarctic krill; it is also likely to be the most important change in benthic habitats over the coming century. For marine mammals and birds, the expected changes primarily relate to their flexibility in moving to alternative locations for food and the energetic cost of longer or more complex foraging trips for those that are bound to breeding colonies. Few species are sufficiently well studied to make comprehensive species‐specific vulnerability assessments possible. Priorities for future work are discussed.<\/jats:p>",

Behavioral reactions to darting were minor and brief. Overall, severe reactions to darting such as long flight responses (7%) and escape to the sea (7%) were uncommon. Midazolam administered by dart failed to produce a satisfactory level of immobilization. Tiletamine‐zolazepam was administered to 120 animals (35 females and 85 males), 104 of which were successfully immobilized and 16 escaped to the water following darting or attempted net capture. At least 10 of the 16 animals are known to have survived. Tiletamine‐zolazepam caused moderate depression of swimming and diving behavior in the animals that escaped to the water. Data from dive loggers confirmed that seals that escaped remained near the sea surface for extended periods. Tiletamine‐zolazepam administered by dart at a mean dosage of 1.87 ± 0.18 mg/kg for females and 1.49 ± 0.23 mg/kg for males provided effective and safe immobilization, reducing capture stress for both animals and personnel. Although there is still a risk of drugged animals escaping to the water and possibly drowning, this risk is much lower than previously reported for other pinnipeds.<\/jats:p>",

Other models have considered the effect of patch quality and predict a net energetic benefit if dives where no prey is encountered early in the dive are abandoned. For deep divers, however, the energetic benefit of giving up is reduced owing to the elevated energy costs associated with descending to physiologically hostile depths, so patch residence time should be invariant. Others consider an asymptotic gain function where the decision to leave a patch is driven by patch‐depletion effects – the marginal value theorem. As predator behaviour is increasingly being used as an index of marine resource density and distribution, it is important to understand the nature of this gain function.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We investigated the dive behaviour of the world's deepest‐diving seal, the southern elephant seal <jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">M<\/jats:styled-content>irounga leonina<\/jats:italic>, in response to patch quality. Testing these models has largely been limited to controlled experiments on captive animals. By integrating <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic> measurements of the seal's relative lipid content obtained from drift rate data (a measure of foraging success) with area‐restricted search behaviour identified from first‐passage time analysis, we identified regions of high‐ and low‐quality patches.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Dive durations and bottom times were not invariant and did not increase in regions of high quality; rather, both were longer when patches were of relatively low quality. This is consistent with the predictions of the marginal value theorem and provides support for a nonlinear relationship between search time and prey acquisition.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We also found higher descent and ascent rates in high‐quality patches suggesting that seals minimized travel time to the foraging patch when quality was high; however, this was not achieved by increasing speed or dive angle. Relative body lipid content was an important predictor of dive behaviour.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Seals did not schedule their diving to maximize time spent in the foraging zone in higher‐quality patches, challenging the widely held view that maximizing time in the foraging zone translates to greater foraging success.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<\/jats:list>\n<\/jats:p>",

A calibrated collection of seal‐derived hydrographic data is now available, consisting of more than 165,000 profiles. The value of these hydrographic data within the existing Southern Ocean observing system is demonstrated herein by conducting two state estimation experiments, differing only in the use or not of seal data to constrain the system. Including seal‐derived data substantially modifies the estimated surface mixed‐layer properties and circulation patterns within and south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Agreement with independent satellite observations of sea ice concentration is improved, especially along the East Antarctic shelf. Instrumented animals efficiently reduce a critical observational gap, and their contribution to monitoring polar climate variability will continue to grow as data accuracy and spatial coverage increase.<\/jats:p>",

An understanding of how body condition changes at fine spatial and temporal scales as a result of interaction with the environment provides necessary information about how animals acquire resources.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>However, comparatively little is known about intra‐ and interindividual variation of condition in marine systems. Where condition has been studied, changes typically are recorded at relatively coarse time‐scales. By quantifying how fine‐scale interaction with the environment influences condition, we can broaden our understanding of how animals acquire resources and allocate them to body stores.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Here we used a hierarchical Bayesian state‐space model to estimate the body condition as measured by the size of an animal's lipid store in two closely related species of marine predator that occupy different hemispheres: northern elephant seals (<jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">M<\/jats:styled-content>irounga angustirostris<\/jats:italic>) and southern elephant seals (<jats:italic><jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">M<\/jats:styled-content>irounga leonina<\/jats:italic>). The observation model linked drift dives to lipid stores. The process model quantified daily changes in lipid stores as a function of the physiological condition of the seal (lipid:lean tissue ratio, departure lipid and departure mass), its foraging location, two measures of behaviour and environmental covariates.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We found that physiological condition significantly impacted lipid gain at two time‐scales – daily and at departure from the colony – that foraging location was significantly associated with lipid gain in both species of elephant seals and that long‐term behavioural phase was associated with positive lipid gain in northern and southern elephant seals. In northern elephant seals, the occurrence of short‐term behavioural states assumed to represent foraging were correlated with lipid gain. Lipid gain was a function of covariates in both species. Southern elephant seals performed fewer drift dives than northern elephant seals and gained lipids at a lower rate.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We have demonstrated a new way to obtain time series of body condition estimates for a marine predator at fine spatial and temporal scales. This modelling approach accounts for uncertainty at many levels and has the potential to integrate physiological and movement ecology of top predators.

However, quantitative interpretation of individual-based telemetry data is hampered by the complexity of, and error within, these multi-dimensional data. Here, we present an integrative hierarchical Bayesian state-space modelling approach where, for the first time, the mechanistic process model for the movement state of animals directly incorporates both environmental and other behavioural information, and observation and process model parameters are estimated within a single model. When applied to a migratory marine predator, the southern elephant seal (\n            <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>\n            ), we find the switch from directed to resident movement state was associated with colder water temperatures, relatively short dive bottom time and rapid descent rates. The approach presented here can have widespread utility for quantifying movement–behaviour (diving or other)–environment relationships across species and systems.\n          <\/jats:p>",

In particular, determining with certainty when an individual breeds for the first time is not always obvious. This can be problematic because uncertainty about the transition from a prebreeder to a breeder state – recruitment – leads to uncertainty in vital rate estimates and in turn in population projection models. To avoid this issue, the common practice is to discard imperfect data from the analyses. However, this practice can generate a bias in vital rate estimates if uncertainty is related to a specific component of the population and reduces the sample size of the dataset and consequently the statistical power to detect effects of biological interest. Here, we compared the demographic parameters assessed from a standard multistate capture–recapture approach to the estimates obtained from the newly developed multi‐event framework that specifically accounts for uncertainty in state assessment. Using a comprehensive longitudinal dataset on southern elephant seals, we demonstrated that the multi‐event model enabled us to use all the data collected (6639 capture–recapture histories vs. 4179 with the multistate model) by accounting for uncertainty in breeding states, thereby increasing the precision and accuracy of the demographic parameter estimates. The multi‐event model allowed us to incorporate imperfect data into demographic analyses. The gain in precision obtained has important implications in the conservation and management of species because limiting uncertainty around vital rates will permit predicting population viability with greater accuracy.<\/jats:p>",

Critical uncertainty in these studies is whether samples from stranded animals are representative of the diet of free-ranging animals. Over two summers, we collected faecal and gastric samples from healthy free-ranging individuals of an extensively studied bottlenose dolphin population. These samples were analysed by molecular prey detection and these data compared with stomach contents data derived from stranded dolphins from the same population collected over 22 years. There was a remarkable consistency in the prey species composition and relative amounts between the two datasets. The conclusions of past stomach contents studies regarding dolphin habitat associations, prey selection and proposed foraging mechanisms are supported by molecular data from live animals and the combined dataset. This is the first explicit test of the validity of stomach contents analysis for accurate population-scale diet determination of an inshore cetacean.<\/jats:p>",

Intrinsic factors, such as body mass and size differences between sexes or species, influence animals’ foraging behaviour, but studies investigating the effects of individual differences in body mass and size within the same sex are scarce. We investigated this in chick‐rearing masked boobies <jats:italic>Sula dactylatra<\/jats:italic>, a species with reversed sexual dimorphism, through the simultaneous deployment of GPS and depth‐acceleration loggers to obtain information on foraging movements and activity patterns. Heavier females performed shorter trips closer to the colony than lighter females. During these shorter trips, heavier females spent higher proportions of their flight time flapping and less time resting on the water than lighter females did during longer trips. In contrast, body mass did not affect trip duration of males, however heavier males spent less time flapping and more time resting on the water than lighter males. This may occur as a result of higher flight costs associated with body mass and allow conservation of energy during locomotion. Body size (i.e. wing length) had no effect on any of the foraging parameters. Dive depths and dive rates (dives h<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) were not affected by body mass, but females dived significantly deeper than males, suggesting that other factors are important. Other studies demonstrated that females are the parent in charge of provisioning the chick, and maintain a flexible investment under regulation of their own body mass. Variation in trip length therefore seems to be triggered by body condition in females, but not in males. Consequently, shorter trips are presumably used to provision the chick, while longer trips are for self‐maintenance. Our findings underline the importance of accounting for the effects of body mass differences within the same sex, if sex‐specific foraging parameters in dimorphic species are being investigated.<\/jats:p>",

Quantifying changes in breeding phenology is important for understanding how populations respond to these changes. While data on shifts in phenology are common for Northern Hemisphere species (especially birds), there is a dearth of evidence from the Southern Hemisphere, and even fewer data available from the marine environment. Surface air temperatures at Macquarie Island have increased by 0.62°C during the 30‐year study period (0.21°C decade<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) and royal penguins (<jats:italic>Eudyptes schlegeli<\/jats:italic>) commenced egg laying on average three days earlier in the 1990s than during the 1960s. This contrasts with other studies of Southern Ocean seabirds; five of nine species are now breeding on average 2.1 days later than during the 1950s. Despite the different direction of these trends, they can be explained by a single underlying mechanism: resource availability. There was a negative relationship between the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and median laying date of royal penguins, such that low‐productivity (low SAM) years delayed laying date. This accords with the observations of other seabird species from the Antarctic, where later laying dates were associated with lower sea ice and lower spring productivity. The unifying factor underpinning phenological trends in eastern Antarctica is therefore resource availability; as food becomes scarcer, birds breed later. These changes are not uniform across the region, however, with resource increases in the subantarctic and decreases in eastern Antarctica.<\/jats:p>",

The latter is unacceptable to some animal welfare advocates, even if it ultimately leads to better conservation outcomes. For effective biodiversity conservation it is imperative that conservation and wildlife researchers lucidly present the case for their research on individual animals. This requires conservation biologists and the research community in general, to present these arguments in the public domain as well as in peer-reviewed literature. Moreover, it is important to measure how these activities affect animals.

Assessing, and subsequently reporting the effects of researcher activities on wild animal populations can be difficult, so that studies to detect these effects sometimes lack rigour or fail to encompass sufficient time to ensure that the effects are tested under a range of environmental stresses. We monitored the effect of investigators working in colonies of two seabirds, the short-tailed shearwater <jats:italic>(Puffinus tenuirostris)<\/jats:italic> and the little penguin <jats:italic>(Eudyptula minor)<\/jats:italic>. Disturbance of breeding birds while checking nests or the weighing of chicks to monitor growth are very common activities for demographic and ecological studies, but how these activities may influence the birds is rarely measured. We investigated differing levels of disturbance during both activities between 2002-03 and 2008-09 to assess their effect on egg laying, chick survival and growth rate and observed no effect for nest checking or handling of short-tailed shearwaters and indeterminate effects for handling in little penguins. Over a period of several years the study has observed a large-scale decline in the number of breeding shearwaters and includes years when control nests had above and below average breeding success.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Survival and reproductive rate estimation requires following uniquely identified individuals through time, and many statistical models assume markings used to identify individuals are permanent. However, survival rates are underestimated when single marks are lost, since the models will effectively score those animals as dead. In order to account for mark loss, some researchers use a double‐mark approach, assuming the probability of losing one mark is independent of losing the other one. Therefore, mark loss can be estimated using animals that have lost one mark. Using a 17‐year dataset of southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) marked with permanent brands and two cattle tags in their hind flippers, we were able to compare tag loss and survival rate estimates with and without the assumption of independent tag loss with respect to age, sex, and wean mass. We demonstrate the assumption of independent tag loss is not valid, showing it is more likely for an animal to lose both tags than just one or the other. The assumption of independent tag loss leads to an underestimate of survival rates which in turn leads to underestimates of population growth rate. In addition, tag loss rates are different by sex and age, with older males more likely to lose tags. Tag loss is also a quadratic function of wean mass through age two, with smaller and larger animals more likely to lose both tags. Such differences are possibly due to differences in behavior, flipper growth, and immune response. Using a Bayesian approach, we will be able to use our tag loss estimates as priors in future analyses for a subset of marked animals that only have flipper tags. With this population, the independent tag loss models are more likely to incorrectly estimate a declining population (growth rate &lt; 1.0), potentially leading to unwarranted management action. To account for non‐independent mark loss in survival rate studies, we recommend researchers use at least two forms of marking on at least a subset of animals. However, neither form of marking need be permanent as long as mark loss is independent between the different forms.<\/jats:p>",

Animals exhibiting foraging site fidelity could also be spatially aware of suitable feeding areas based on prior experience; changes in movement patterns might therefore arise from the anticipation of higher prey density. We tested the hypothesis that regions of area‐restricted search were associated with a higher number of daily speed spikes (a proxy for potential prey encounter rate) and foraging success in southern elephant seals (<jats:italic><jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Mirounga leonina<\/jats:named-content><\/jats:italic>), a species exhibiting both area‐restricted searches and high interannual foraging site fidelity. We used onshore morphological measurements and diving data from archival tags deployed during winter foraging trips. Foraging success was inferred from in situ changes in relative lipid content derived from measured changes in buoyancy, and first‐passage time analysis was used to identify area‐restricted search behavior. Seals exhibited relatively direct southerly movement on average, with intensive search behavior predominantly located at the distal end of tracks. The probability of being in search mode was positively related to changes in relative lipid content; thus, intensively searched areas were associated with the highest foraging success. However, there was high foraging success during the outward transit even though seals moved through quickly without slowing down and increasing turning rate to exploit these areas. In addition, the probability of being in search mode was negatively related to the number of daily speed spikes. These results suggest that movement patterns represent a response to prior expectation of the location of predictable and profitable resources. Shelf habitat was 4–9 times more profitable than the other habitats, emphasizing the importance of the East Antarctic shelf for this and other predators in the region. We have provided rare empirical data with which to investigate the relationship between predator foraging strategy and prey encounter/foraging success, underlining the importance of inferring the timing and spatial arrangement of successful food acquisition for interpreting foraging strategies correctly.<\/jats:p>",

Telomeres are nucleoprotein structures on the ends of chromosomes that change size throughout the life of many animals and because of this property have been advocated as a means to estimate age. In this review, we assess the existing and potential application of using telomeres for age estimation. We argue that there are conceptual and statistical inconsistencies in previous studies and that the basis for telomere change over time is not well understood and affected by several intrinsic and extrinsic process unrelated to chronological time. Furthermore, these processes are likely to vary spatially and temporally for animal populations. We conclude that the current data suggest telomeres should not be used for age estimation. If telomere‐based age estimation is to be used, more work in understanding variability in key processes affecting telomere dynamics and rigorous substantiation via blind testing is needed.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Abstract. Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina), fitted with Conductivity-Temperature-Depth sensors at Macquarie Island in January 2005 and 2010, collected unique oceanographic observations of the Adélie and George V Land continental shelf (140–148° E) during the summer-fall transition (late February through April). This is a key region of dense shelf water formation from enhanced sea ice growth/brine rejection in the local coastal polynyas. In 2005, two seals occupied the continental shelf break near the grounded icebergs at the northern end of the Mertz Glacier Tongue for several weeks from the end of February. One of the seals migrated west to the Dibble Ice Tongue, apparently utilising the Antarctic Slope Front current near the continental shelf break. In 2010, immediately after that year's calving of the Mertz Glacier Tongue, two seals migrated to the same region but penetrated much further southwest across the Adélie Depression and sampled the Commonwealth Bay polynya from March through April. Here we present observations of the regional oceanography during the summer-fall transition, in particular (i) the zonal distribution of modified Circumpolar Deep Water exchange across the shelf break, (ii) the upper ocean stratification across the Adélie Depression, including alongside iceberg C-28 that calved from the Mertz Glacier and (iii) the convective overturning of the deep remnant seasonal mixed layer in Commonwealth Bay from sea ice growth. Heat and freshwater budgets to 200–300 m are used to estimate the ocean heat content (400→50 MJ m−2), flux (50–200 W m−2 loss) and sea ice growth rates (maximum of 7.5–12.5 cm day−1). Mean seal-derived sea ice growth rates were within the range of satellite-derived estimates from 1992–2007 using ERA-Interim data. We speculate that the continuous foraging by the seals within Commonwealth Bay during the summer/fall transition was due to favorable feeding conditions resulting from the convective overturning of the deep seasonal mixed layer and chlorophyll maximum that is a reported feature of this location.<\/jats:p>",

This has led to a focus in recent literature on the identification of “hotspots” important for migratory marine predators, i.e., regions where predators spend disproportionate amounts of time ostensibly due to high prey abundance; and determination of the environmental features characteristic of such areas. We investigated factors predicting foraging success in southern bluefin tuna (SBT; <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Thunnus maccoyii<\/jats:named-content>), by integrating telemetry‐based feeding and movement data (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 19 fish, length to caudal fork [LCF] = 99 ± 3 cm) with environmental data over the scale of their annual oceanic migrations during 1998–2000. We used widely available statistical modeling techniques, generalized linear models, and generalized linear mixed models, formulated to represent feeding as a Markov process. The results showed increased feeding and predictability of feeding occurs in the coastal waters of southern Australia, providing some evidence that this area represents a fixed foraging “hotspot” for juvenile tuna during the austral summer. However, in oceanic waters southern bluefin tuna did not fit the common model of migration, but rather showed a pattern of relatively high foraging success throughout their migratory range, especially during periods of continuous travel. Interestingly, foraging “coldspots” (prolonged low‐feeding periods) as well as “hotspots” were apparent across individual tracks, predicted most strongly by warm ocean temperatures. These results provide a new perspective on the ecology of large‐scale feeding migrations within the context of the heterogeneous ocean environment, where the continuous and opportunistic feeding of generalist predators may be more common, particularly in predatory large pelagic fishes, than is currently documented.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Predictable sources of food underpin lifetime reproductive output in long lived animals. The most important foraging areas of top marine predators are therefore likely to be related to environmental features that enhance productivity in predictable spatial and temporal patterns. Even so, although productive areas within the marine environment are distributed patchily in space and time, most studies assess the relationships between feeding activity and proximate, not long term, environmental characteristics. In addition, individuals within a population may exploit different prey types, and these are often associated with different hydrographic features. Until now, models attempting to associate core foraging areas (CFAs) of marine predators with the environmental characteristics of those areas have not considered the diet of individual animals, despite the influence this could have on these relationships. We used bathymetry and multi‐year (n=24) mean sea surface temperature and variability as predictors of CFAs of lactating Antarctic fur seals <jats:italic>Arctocephalus gazella<\/jats:italic> at Heard Island. The effect of prey types on the predictability of these models was explored by matching diet and foraging trip data of individual seals (n=40 seals, n=1 trip each). Differences in diet between seals were mirrored by their spatial behaviour. Foraging strategies differed both between and within groups of seals consuming different diets. Long‐term environmental parameters were useful for predicting the foraging activity of seals that consumed a single prey type with relatively specific habitat preferences, but not for those that consumed single or multiple prey types associated with more varied habitats. Ignoring individual variation in predator diet probably contributes to the poor performance of foraging habitat models. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating individual specialization in foraging behaviour into ecological models and management of predator populations.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Recent studies have applied state–space models to satellite telemetry data in order to remove noise from raw location estimates and infer the true tracks of animals. However, while the resulting tracks may appear plausible, it is difficult to determine the accuracy of the estimated positions, especially for position estimates interpolated to times between satellite locations. In this study, we use data from two gray seals (<jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Halichoerus grypus<\/jats:named-content>) carrying tags that transmitted Fastloc GPS positions via Argos satellites. This combination of Service Argos data and highly accurate GPS data allowed examination of the accuracy of state–space position estimates and their uncertainty derived from satellite telemetry data. After applying a speed filter to remove aberrant satellite telemetry locations, we fit a continuous‐time Kalman filter to estimate the parameters of a random walk, used Kalman smoothing to infer positions at the times of the GPS measurements, and then compared the filtered telemetry estimates with the actual GPS measurements. We investigated the effect of varying maximum speed thresholds in the speed‐filtering algorithm on the root mean‐square error (RMSE) estimates and used minimum RMSE as a criterion to guide the final choice of speed threshold. The optimal speed thresholds differed between the two animals (1.1 m/s and 2.5 m/s) and retained 50% and 65% of the data for each seal. However, using a speed filter of 1.1 m/s resulted in very similar RMSE for both animals. For the two seals, the RMSE of the Kalman‐filtered estimates of location were 5.9 and 12.76 km, respectively, and 75% of the modeled positions had errors less than 6.25 km and 11.7 km for each seal. Confidence interval coverage was close to correct at typical levels (80–95%), although it tended to be overly generous at smaller sizes. The reliability of uncertainty estimates was also affected by the chosen speed threshold. The combination of speed and Kalman filtering allows for effective calculation of location and also indicates the limits of accuracy when correcting service Argos locations and linking satellite telemetry data to spatial covariate and habitat data.<\/jats:p>",

An initial step to estimating likelihood of seabird bycatch and conceiving conservation strategies is determining amount of overlap between foraging birds and commercial fishing effort, identifying oceanographic features associated with foraging birds, and quantifying dive characteristics. We tracked 24 adult flesh‐footed shearwaters (<jats:italic>Puffinus carneipes<\/jats:italic>) breeding on Lord Howe Island located east of Australia during incubation and early and late chick‐rearing periods from 6 January to 17 April 2005. At‐sea foraging distribution of flesh‐footed shearwaters was primarily confined within the jurisdictional Australian Fishing Zone. Foraging was strongly associated with sea‐surface temperature &gt;24°C. Spatial and temporal overlap of longline fishing with foraging shearwaters varied throughout the breeding season, but was greatest (63% overlap) during early chick‐rearing. Mean maximum distance reached from the breeding colony during a foraging event was 804 km (SD = 280) from Lord Howe Island. Foraging behavior was strongly diurnal, with 91% of dives occurring during daylight, and most dives (77%) were &lt;5 m. Given that longline fishing and flesh‐footed shearwaters overlap substantially, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority should consider implementing additional regulations to further reduce bycatch. Conservation strategies such as setting longlines at nights may reduce flesh‐footed shearwater bycatch.<\/jats:p>",

In this paper we use archival tag data from juvenile southern bluefin tuna (<jats:italic>Thunnus maccoyii<\/jats:italic>, SBT) to (i) develop a novel approach characterising the oceanographic habitats used throughout an annual migration cycle on the basis of water column structure (i.e., temperature‐at‐depth data from tags), and (ii) model how the vertical behaviour of SBT altered in relation to habitat type and other factors. Using this approach, we identified eight habitat types occupied by juvenile SBT between the southern margin of the subtropical gyre and the northern edge of the Subantarctic Front in the south Indian Ocean. Although a high degree of variability was evident both within and between fish, mixed‐effect models identified consistent behavioural responses to habitat, lunar phase, migration status and diel period. Our results indicate SBT do not act to maintain preferred depth or temperature ranges, but rather show highly plastic behaviours in response to changes in their environment. This plasticity is discussed in terms of the potential proximate causes (physiological, ecological) and with reference to the challenges posed for habitat‐based standardisation of fishery data used in stock assessments.<\/jats:p>",

In such studies, these sequences are generally assumed to be the only version present in DNA of the organism of interest. However, nuclear pseudogenes that display variable similarity to the mitochondrial versions are common in many taxa. The presence of nuclear pseudogenes that co-amplify with their mitochondrial paralogues can lead to several possible confounding interpretations when applied to estimating animal diet. Here, we investigate the occurrence of nuclear pseudogenes in fecal samples taken from bottlenose dolphins (<jats:italic>Tursiops truncatus<\/jats:italic>) that were assayed for prey DNA with a universal primer technique. We found pseudogenes in 13 of 15 samples and 1–5 pseudogene haplotypes per sample representing 5–100% of all amplicons produced. The proportion of amplicons that were pseudogenes and the diversity of prey DNA recovered per sample were highly variable and appear to be related to PCR cycling characteristics. This is a well-sampled system where we can reliably identify the putative pseudogenes and separate them from their mitochondrial paralogues using a number of recommended means. In many other cases, it would be virtually impossible to determine whether a putative prey sequence is actually a pseudogene derived from either the predator or prey DNA. The implications of this for DNA-based dietary studies, in general, are discussed.<\/jats:p>",

However, the difficulty in obtaining\n            <jats:italic>in situ<\/jats:italic>\n            data means that our ability to detect and interpret change is very limited, especially in the Southern Ocean, where the ocean beneath the sea ice remains almost entirely unobserved and the rate of sea-ice formation is poorly known. Here, we show that southern elephant seals (\n            <jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>\n            ) equipped with oceanographic sensors can measure ocean structure and water mass changes in regions and seasons rarely observed with traditional oceanographic platforms. In particular, seals provided a 30-fold increase in hydrographic profiles from the sea-ice zone, allowing the major fronts to be mapped south of 60°S and sea-ice formation rates to be inferred from changes in upper ocean salinity. Sea-ice production rates peaked in early winter (April–May) during the rapid northward expansion of the pack ice and declined by a factor of 2 to 3 between May and August, in agreement with a three-dimensional coupled ocean–sea-ice model. By measuring the high-latitude ocean during winter, elephant seals fill a “blind spot” in our sampling coverage, enabling the establishment of a truly global ocean-observing system.\n          <\/jats:p>",

It is often only possible to examine the combined effects of these factors through measurements made over long periods, spanning an array of population densities or levels of food availability. Using age-structured mark-recapture models and datasets spanning five decades (1950–1999), and two periods of differing relative population density, we estimated age-specific probabilities of survival and examined the combined effects of population density and environmental conditions on juvenile survival of southern elephant seals at Macquarie Island.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>First-year survival decreased with density during the period of highest population size, and survival increased during years when the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) anomaly (deviation from a 50-year mean) during the mother's previous foraging trip to sea was positive (i.e., El Niño). However, when environmental stochasticity and density were considered together, the effect of density on first-year survival effectively disappeared. Ignoring density effects also leads to models placing too much emphasis on the environmental conditions prevailing during the naïve pup's first year at sea.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>Our analyses revealed that both the state of the environment and population density combine to modify juvenile survival, but that the degree to which these processes contributed to the variation observed was interactive and complex. This underlines the importance of evaluating the relative contribution of both the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that regulate animal populations because false conclusions regarding the importance of population regulation may be reached if they are examined in isolation.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>",

The age of each animal was estimated through examination of growth layer groups in the cementum of a postcanine tooth, which was removed from each seal. Females ranged in age from 1.5 to 23.4 years and males from 1.5 to 16.7 years. Gompertz and two‐component logistic growth models were used to predict sex‐specific growth patterns in body length and mass and to compare growth strategies. During the non‐breeding season, physically mature adult males were on average 1.2 times longer and 2.2 times heavier than adult females. Sexual size dimorphism was most apparent after the age of 5–7 years, when differences in predicted growth rates were most evident. Post‐weaning growth in females was predicted to be monophasic, characterized by high growth rates in length and mass during the juvenile growth stage, followed by a gradual decline in growth rates after reproductive maturity. In contrast, growth in males was predicted to be biphasic, with an apparent secondary growth spurt in both length and mass that coincided with sexual and social maturation, followed by a rapid decline in growth rates after social maturity. However, the number of males sampled between 9 and 10 years was low and is likely to have biased growth rates for sub‐adults to some degree. Females were predicted to continue to gain body mass over a number of years following reproductive maturity, whereas adult males appeared to trade off further somatic growth with a marked seasonal accumulation and loss of mass in relation to the breeding season.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p> Over-snow vehicles are used extensively at Antarctic scientific research stations. Adult female Weddell seals ( Leptonychotes weddellii (Lesson, 1826)) also utilise the fast-ice and are therefore often exposed to vehicular activity, with the potential of affecting their behaviour. Guidelines for vehicular travel have been developed to minimise disturbance to Antarctic wildlife; however, these guidelines have not yet been scientifically tested. To examine the efficiency and sensitivity of existing guidelines used within the Australian Antarctic Territory (AAT), we conducted drive-by experiments of two types of over-snow vehicles. The results of these experiments showed that the probability of a lactating Weddell seal looking at the vehicles and the duration of the seals’ looking at the vehicles were dependent on the distance between vehicles and seals, the position of the pups in relation to its mother, and the distance the adult female was from the water. Although the seals apparently perceived the vehicles to be a threat, no seals fled in response to vehicle activity. We propose that the existing guidelines used in the AAT could be amended to increase separation distances between vehicles and breeding Weddell seals if the goal of management is to ensure that Weddell seal behaviour is unaffected by vehicle travel. <\/jats:p>",

Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in particular can be exposed to anthropogenic noise because they live under, and breed on, the fast ice on which humans travel. To investigate the potential effects of anthropogenic noise on Weddell seals we developed sound profiles for pedestrian travel, over-snow vehicles, aircraft and watercraft operating at various distances and altitudes from breeding seals. The received 1/3-octave noise levels were then related to an assumed detection threshold for the Weddell seal. We found that most noise levels generated by the pedestrian, quad (4-wheeled, all-terrain vehicle) and Hagglunds (tracked, all-terrain vehicle) were commonly categorised in the inaudible and barely audible range of detection (both in-air and underwater), while noise levels generated by the helicopter, Twin Otter aircraft and Zodiac boat were categorised more commonly in the barely audible and clearly audible range. Experimental underwater recordings of vocal behaviour of Weddell seals exposed to continuous low-amplitude over-snow vehicle noise (i.e. Hagglund operation) were also made. Weddell seals underwater did not alter individual call types in response to low-level Hagglunds noise, but they did decrease their calling rate.\n<\/jats:p>",

In addition to individual sensitivity, physiological status may play an important role. We investigated the use of the intravenous administration of a 1:1 mixture of tiletamine and zolazepam (Telazol<jats:sup>®<\/jats:sup>) to immobilize adult females at different points during a physiologically demanding 5–6 week lactation period. We also compared performance between IV and IM injection of the same mixture.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>The tiletamine:zolazepam mixture administered intravenously was an effective method for immobilization with no fatalities or pronounced apnoeas in 106 procedures; however, there was a 25 % (one animal in four) mortality rate with intramuscular administration. Induction time was slightly longer for females at the end of lactation (54.9 ± 2.3 seconds) than at post-parturition (48.2 ± 2.9 seconds). In addition, the number of previous captures had a positive effect on induction time. There was no evidence for effects due to age, condition (total body lipid), stage of lactation or number of captures on recovery time.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusion<\/jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We suggest that intravenous administration of tiletamine and zolazepam is an effective and safe immobilizing agent for female Weddell seals. Although individual traits could not explain variation in recovery time, we suggest careful monitoring of recovery times during longitudinal studies (&gt; 2 captures). We show that physiological pressures do not substantially affect response to chemical immobilization with this mixture; however, consideration must be taken for differences that may exist for immobilization of adult males and juveniles. Nevertheless, we recommend a mass-specific dose of 0.50 – 0.65 mg/kg for future procedures with adult female Weddell seals and a starting dose of 0.50 mg/kg for other age classes and other phocid seals.<\/jats:p>\n          <\/jats:sec>",

During these \"drift dives\" seals are thought to preferentially direct energy towards processing of food, lactate, or renal metabolites rather than to active propulsion. We describe the first drift dives reported in an otariid, the New Zealand fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri (Lesson, 1828)), studied at Kangaroo Island in South Australia. Not all males in the study undertook drift dives and those that did were significantly heavier than those that did not, suggesting that body size may influence the propensity to drift dive in New Zealand fur seals. Drift dives lasted 6.0 ± 1.78 min and had passive drift segments of 3.5 ± 1.5 min, during which seals showed a negative change in depth (i.e., sinking) of 0.14 ± 0.05 m/s. Drift dives occurred at night and were possibly undertaken to avoid near-surface predators and to process food, lactate, or renal metabolites while resting. <\/jats:p>",

We conducted a captive feeding trial to test whether prey DNA could be reliably detected in scat samples from Steller sea lions (<jats:italic>Eumetopias jubatus<\/jats:italic>). Two sea lions were fed a diet of fish (five species) and squid (one species), and DNA was extracted from the soft component of collected scats. Most of the DNA obtained came from the predator, but prey DNA could be amplified using prey‐specific primers. The four prey species fed in consistent daily proportions throughout the trial were detected in more than 90% of the scat DNA extractions. Squid and sockeye salmon, which were fed as a relatively small percentage of the daily diet, were detected as reliably as the more abundant diet items. Prey detection was erratic in scats collected when the daily diet was fed in two meals that differed in prey composition, suggesting that prey DNA is passed in meal specific pulses. Prey items that were removed from the diet following one day of feeding were only detected in scats collected within 48 h of ingestion. Proportions of fish DNA present in eight scat samples (evaluated through the screening of clone libraries) were roughly proportional to the mass of prey items consumed, raising the possibility that DNA quantification methods could provide semi‐quantitative diet composition data. This study should be of broad interest to researchers studying diet since it highlights an approach that can accurately identify prey species and is not dependent on prey hard parts surviving digestion.<\/jats:p>",

Data spanning 1920–2002, involving a total of 639 stranding events and 39 taxa groups from southeast Australia, were found to demonstrate a clear 11–13- year periodicity in the number of events through time. These data positively correlated with the regional persistence of both zonal (westerly) and meridional (southerly) winds, reflecting general long-term and large-scale shifts in sea-level pressure gradients. Periods of persistent zonal and meridional winds result in colder and presumably nutrient-rich waters being driven closer to southern Australia, resulting in increased biological activity in the water column during the spring months. These observations suggest that large-scale climatic events provide a powerful distal influence on the propensity for whales to strand in this region. These patterns provide a powerful quantitative framework for testing hypotheses regarding environmental links to strandings and provide managers with a potential predictive tool to prepare for years of peak stranding activity.<\/jats:p>",

Daily attendance patterns and body mass were recorded using an Automated Penguin Monitoring System, which collected arrival and departure masses for approximately 200 breeding birds over the 2000 and 2001 breeding seasons. Breeding success varied between the two years; 2000 was a year of average breeding success (fledging 1.07 chicks per pair), and 2001 a year of poor breeding success (fledging 0.53 chicks per pair). In both years, adult body condition (body mass divided by flipper length) increased significantly prior to laying. The laying period began over a month later in 2000 than in 2001, and birds in 2000 exhibited significantly better body condition at laying. However, the mean laying dates in 2000 were less variable than in the 2001 breeding season. Body condition appeared to influence both the time of breeding and breeding synchrony in Little Penguins. Breeding success was correlated with adult body condition at incubation in 2000 but not in 2001, indicating that success was not solely influenced by adult body condition at incubation.<\/jats:p>",

Using data from 28 separate foraging trips (22 unique individuals) over two years, we found that during the post-lactation trips (summer), the best GLM demonstrated a negative relationship between time at sea and SST and BA, but a positive relationship with SST gradient and SSH. During the post-moult (winter) trips, there was a negative relationship with OC gradient, SSH, and BA. The best post-lactation GAM identified a positive relationship with OC gradient, negative relationships with OC and SST gradient, and a non-linear relationship with SST. For the post-moult trip there was a negative relationship with OC, SST, BA and BA gradient, and a positive relationship with SST gradient. The relationship between the predicted time and observed time at sea was significant only for the post-lactation GAM, although predictability was low. That SST and its gradient predicted a small, but significant proportion of the variation in time at sea is indicative of the frontal zones within this area that are generally more biologically productive than surrounding regions. It appears that coarse-scale oceanographic configuration influences foraging behaviour in southern elephant seals only subtly. Nonetheless, some of the mechanisms influencing predator foraging are congruent with expectations of distribution of marine food resources at coarse spatial scales.<\/jats:p>",

Dorsal total lengths were also measured. Ages of females ranged from 0.75 to 64 years, with the majority (77%) aged between 20 and 45 years. Total lengths of female sperm whales ranged from 417–1200 cm, with 68% of females 1050–1200 cm long. Constraints associated with the age structure observed in this study and the representativeness of the age structure to that of the greater population are discussed. In an effort to assess the effects of underestimation of age estimates on age‐specific demographic parameters, a model simulating changes in age structure as a result of tooth wear was developed and the resulting survival rates compared to those derived from the original age structures of the samples. Survival did not change significantly between the modelled and original age structures. Also, the survival rate calculated from Australian mature female sperm whales was compared to that calculated from sperm whales caught in whaling operations from Japanese waters. Australian mature female sperm whales demonstrated significantly higher survival rates (mean=0.905±0.046 <jats:sc>sd<\/jats:sc> range: 0.856–0.986) than mature females from Japanese waters (mean=0.885±0.034 <jats:sc>sd<\/jats:sc>; range=0.859–0.970), possibly the reflection of higher fishing mortality on the Japanese whales. Growth equations using Gompertz and von Bertalanffy models were calculated for female Australian sperm whales and compared. Both models described growth in female sperm whales similarly. Changes in the demographic parameters of sperm whales with the cessation of whaling may be reflected in the growth rates of individuals and as such, these equations may provide a useful tool for monitoring continuing changes in the demographic parameters of this species. Without long‐term mark–recapture studies on sperm whales in this region, the frequent stranding of sperm whales in south‐eastern Australia provides an important opportunity to collect data on the life history and demography of this species.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Stomach contents were collected from 36 sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) involved in two mass stranding events during February 1998 along the west coastline of Tasmania, Australia. Contents were dominated by oceanic cephalopods, with a total of 101 883 cephalopod beaks representing 48 species from 14 families of Teuthids, two species from two families of Octopods, and a single Vampyromorph species identified. Species diversity was higher in these animals than other sperm whales studied in the southern hemisphere, with samples containing an average of (±s.d.) 28.4 ± 11.1 species per sample. Diet samples were dominated by subtropical and muscular cephalopod species. Members of the family Histioteuthidae were the most important numerically, and were also important in terms of estimated reconstituted mass, although members of the Onychoteuthidae were the most dominant species in samples in terms of estimated reconstituted mass. Other families numerically important to species composition included the cranchiid, lepidoteuthid, onychoteuthid, and pholidoteuthid families, while the architeuthid, pholidoteuthid, and ommastrephid families were also important in terms of reconstituted mass. Cephalopod species composition varied with stranding site and with sex, but not with age. However, differences did not represent systemic variation with groups marked by high individual variability. Lower rostral lengths of all cephalopod species ranged from 1.3 to 40.7 mm. Calculated dorsal mantle lengths from all species ranged from 10.7 to 2640.7 mm (mean ± s.d. = 233.7 ± 215.7 mm) and estimated wet weights of cephalopod prey ranged from 2.7 to 110 233.1 g (mean ± s.d. = 828.3 ± 3073.6 g). While there were differences in the size of some cephalopod species between stranding sites and with age, this was marked by high individual variability. Differences in diet composition and prey size between sperm whales reflect individual variability in foraging success and perhaps also foraging groups related to the social structure of this species.<\/jats:p>",

In the Southern Ocean little information exists on the spatial and temporal patterns of resource use by predators, so we attempted to examine these patterns for an important Antarctic predator, the southern elephant seal. We (i) defined the area of the ocean used by the adult female component of the elephant seal population at Macquarie Island; (ii) quantified the time these seals spent in the different regions of the Southern Ocean; and (iii) estimated the biomass of fish and squid prey consumed per fortnight and per region.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We used data from 42 post‐breeding females collected from 1992 to 2001. The data consisted of locations determined by geo‐location (based on light intensity) recorded using dataloggers. A randomized, incremental analysis of at‐sea locations indicated that a sample of 25 individuals was required to provide 95% coverage of the total area of ocean used.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>The greatest amount of time (44·6%) was spent in the region between the Antarctic Polar Front (APF) and the Subantarctic Front (SAF).

Our study emphasizes that (i) a large sample of individual seals (25) can estimate spatial trends in prey consumption; (ii) much of the estimated prey consumption occurs within fishery‐managed zones, therefore elephant seals should be included in models predicting trophic structure in the Southern Ocean; and (iii) recent commercial fishery catch within these zones is minimal relative to the prey consumed by elephant seals, but increases in fishing activity in these zones may result in competition for marine resources.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<\/jats:list>\n<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina) typically give birth to a single pup and raise it over a short 24-day lactation period. Lactation is characterised by: maternal fasting, rapid pup growth and abrupt weaning after which the weaned pups rely on stored fat for growth and survival. Females are not able to transfer all of their stored resources to their pups because they themselves need to use some to return to their remote foraging grounds after the breeding effort. Therefore the amount of energy expended by a female during lactation may affect not only the survival of her pup, but her own survival and future reproductive success. Female southern elephant seals are therefore under strong selective pressure to allocate finite amounts of resources to their pups. In the rare event of producing twins, females that wean both pups are likely to experience reduced reproductive success. Twin births accounted for 0.38% of all the observed elephant seal births at Macquarie Island in 1999. The mean birth masses, weaning lengths and lactation duration for twin and singleton pups did not differ significantly but weaning mass, weaning girths and lactation growth rates did differ significantly. In all cases, singleton pups were larger and grew faster than twin pups. Twin pups suffered greater pre-weaning mortality than singletons (16.7% and 4.6% respectively) and fewer were seen alive after 18 months (20% compared with 47% respectively). <\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Twenty-three juvenile (8–14 months of age) southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic> L.) from Macquarie Island were tracked during 1993 and 1995. Migratory tracks and ocean areas with concentrated activity, presumed to be foraging grounds, were established from location data gathered by attached geolocation-time depth recorders. The seals ranged widely (811–3258 km) and foraging activity centred on oceanographic frontal systems, especially the Antarctic Polar Front and bathymetric features such as the Campbell Plateau region. The seals spent 58.6% of their sea time within managed fishery areas while the remainder was spent on the high seas, an area of unregulated fishing. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) areas 58.4.1, 88.2 and especially 88.1 were important and distant foraging areas for these juvenile elephant seals. From fisheries records, diet and the foraging ecology studies of the seals there appears to be little, if any, overlap or conflict between the seals and commercial fishing operations within the regulated commercial areas. However, attention is drawn to the possibility of future interactions if Southern Ocean fisheries expand or new ones commence.<\/jats:p>",

Australian fur seals have the highest birth mass of any fur seal species (male 8.3 kg; female 7.2 kg). While their absolute pre‐weaning growth rate (male 62 g·day<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>; female 53 g·day<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) is similar to that of other temperate latitude fur seals, they have the longest birth‐mass doubling time of any otariid species (134–136 days). Daily milk consumption increased from 400 g·day<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup> (5 MJ·day<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) after birth to 675 g·day<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup> (13.7 MJ·day<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) at age 210 day. However, mean mass‐specific milk consumption (41 g·kg<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) is substantially lower than in other otariid species (58–70 g·kg<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>) and, combined with a low mass gain efficiency (0.12 g·g<jats:sup>−1<\/jats:sup>), contributes to the low mass‐specific growth rates observed. There were no significant differences in either absolute or mass‐specific milk consumption between the sexes. Significant differences, however, were found between the sexes in the body composition of pups with females generally having larger body lipid stores than males for any given mass. Peak milk yield by Australian fur seal females is estimated at 0.60 MJkg<jats:sup>−0.75<\/jats:sup>, substantially less than in Antarctic fur seals. The low level of maternal energy transfer in Australian fur seals may reflect the relatively low marine productivity of their foraging areas.<\/jats:p>",

The two species have different lactation strategies, the former rearing its pup in 4 months and the latter taking 10 months. The diet and at-sea foraging behaviour of these sympatric species was compared during the austral summer period when their pup rearing period overlapped. The prey of the two fur seal species was very similar, with fish dominating the diet. The myctophid, Electrona subaspera, was the main prey item (93.9%) in all months of the study. There were no major differences in the diving behaviour between species. Both species foraged north of the island parallel to the Macquarie Ridge. Foraging activity was concentrated at two sites: (i) within 30�km north of the island; and (ii) at 60 km north. Most locations for overnight foraging trips were within 10 km of the colonies. The different lactation strategies of A. gazella and A. tropicalis allowed for flexibility in foraging behaviour. At Macquarie Island, the local marine environmental conditions have resulted in similar foraging behaviour for both species.<\/jats:p>",

The study was conducted in the Mertz Glacier Polynya region from July to August 1999. In total 89 crabeater seals were seen in 26 groups which ranged in size from 1 to 35 animals (mean = 3.2). The mean observed haulout density along a 200 m wide strip transect was 0.108 seals per km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>, or 0.042 groups per km<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup>. Crabeater seals were not uniformly distributed in the polynya but selected areas of stable ice over shallow (&lt; 1000 m) waters. We used a generalized linear model to assess the relationship of seal distribution to the physical attributes of sea ice concentration, thickness, and ocean depth. We found that ice thickness and ocean depth were the most important determinants of seal distribution. Crabeater seals occurred in areas where the ice affords them a stable haulout platform while allowing them access to Antarctic krill that live directly beneath the ice.<\/jats:p>",

Four water bodies were determined from depth/temperature profiles recorded by the GLTDTRs. These water bodies corresponded to Sub-Antarctic Mode Water (SAMW), Polar Front Zone Water (PFZW), Polar Front Water (PFW) and Antarctic Water Masses (AWM). Thermal structures within these water bodies did not influence seal diving behaviour. Overall mean dive depth, nocturnal dive depths, diurnal dive depths and dive duration were similar in all areas. However, individuals did change behaviour as they moved between different water bodies. Seals also used different water bodies in the two different years of the study. We suggest that variations in foraging behaviour among seals are a result of prey distribution associated with local oceanographic conditions, but also reflect important individual foraging strategies within thermal zones.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The ability to forage successfully during their first trip to sea is fundamental to the ultimate survival of newly weaned southern elephant seals (Mirounga leonina). However, there is considerable variation in the body mass and fat content of seal pups at weaning, which results in some individuals having larger energy and oxygen stores than others, which may confer advantages on them. The diving behaviour of 21 newly weaned seals was studied using satellite relayed data loggers. Seals were captured at Macquarie Island in December 1995 and 1996, approximately 4 weeks after weaning. Two groups of seals were specifically targeted: a heavy group from the top quartile of weaning masses (n = 6) and a light group from the lower quartile (n = 15). Most of the seals made dives in excess of 100 m depth and 5 min before final departure from the island. However, for the first 60-80 d, all of the seals exhibited behaviour quite distinct from the patterns reported for older conspecifics, and made relatively shallow (100 ± 39 m; mean ± SD) and short (5.7 ± 1.23 min) dives. During this time the seals spent 74.3 ± 12.6% of each day diving, and the depth of the dives did not follow any diurnal pattern. The diving behaviour of all seals changed abruptly when they started on their return to land. During this time their behaviour was more like that of adults: they made deeper (159 ± 9 m) and longer dives (9.01 ± 1.69 min) than previously, and the dives showed a strong diurnal pattern in depth. There is no obvious explanation for this change in behaviour, although its abrupt nature suggests that it is unlikely to have been due to physiological changes in the seals. The size of the seals at weaning was an important influence on diving behaviour. Heavy weaners made significantly deeper (130 ± 40 m) and longer dives (7.36 ± 0.55 min) than light weaners (88 ± 32 m and 5.04 ± 0.64 min, respectively). This indicates that smaller seals are constrained to some extent by their physiological capabilities, which perhaps requires some individuals to adopt different foraging strategies.<\/jats:p>",

Gentoo Penguins are considered to be inshore feeders, and at Macquarie Island the diet and estimated foraging ranges supported this. The diet consisted of 91.6% fish and 8.3% squid, by mass. The dominant prey taxa were the fish <jats:italic>Gymnoscopelus<\/jats:italic> sp. and <jats:italic>Paranotothenia magellanica.<\/jats:italic> A mixture of pelagic and benthic prey was consumed, with a greater proportion of benthic species occurring later in the season. The penguins exhibited a strong diurnal pattern in their diving behaviour. Deep diving (≥30 m) began near sunrise (03.00 h) and finished close to sunset (21.00 h). Diving at night was less common and very shallow (&lt;10 m). Early in the breeding season, dive profiles indicated that birds were probably following vertically migrating pelagic prey through the water column and were foraging in waters over 100 m deep. Later in the season, more uniform, shallower depths were used, suggesting an increase in benthic foraging activity. These changes in dive pattern and depth were consistent with the habitat preferences of prey species found in the diet. Gentoo Penguins swam at 1.04 m per <jats:italic>s<\/jats:italic> and had a maximum potential foraging range of about 26 km for single‐day trips. They tended to forage within 14 km of the colony, with a mean range of 5.4 km. This range encompassed the deep ocean habitat to the west and east of the island and a shallow area to the north.<\/jats:p>",

Winter rates of water influx for koalas from Springsure were lower than those recorded for koalas from Victoria for the same period of the year.  Mass-corrected feeding rates were lower in summer than winter; wet food intake was significantly lower than reported for similar sized female koalas from Victoria.  The preferred browse was Eucalyptus crebra in winter and E. tereticornis in summer.

The proportion of body mass represented by fat was less than 3% at birth, increasing to 40.8+/-12.7% at weaning.  Lean tissue mass altered little for most of the lactation period, but did show an increase in the last four days.  The fat content of the milk reflected these changes, starting at 16.1+/-6.98% on Day 1 of lactation and increasing to 39.5+/-15.2% about the time of weaning.  Fat content of the milk was, however, highly variable and at weaning ranged from 7% to 55%.  Although the growth rate of the pup was correlated with mass lost by its mother during lactation, there was no relationship between maternal mass and weaning weight of pups.  It is suggested that growth rates may be related to maternal condition and not simply mass, and, further, that differences in growth rates between populations of southern elephant seals are related to maternal energy reserves.<\/jats:p>",

Six distinct dive types were described on the basis of parameters such as the amount of time spent at the maximum depth of the dive, the rate of ascent and descent, and the general form of the dive profile. These dive types were 'rest' dives, 'travel' dives, 'surface' dives, 'general non-foraging' dives, 'pelagic foraging' dives and 'benthic foraging' dives. The seals spent 90% of their time at sea submerged. Less than 2% of the time was spent on the surface in intervals of more than 10 min. A further 20-30% of the time was spent on the various non-foraging types of dives. Most females performed only 'pelagic foraging' dives, while males performed both 'pelagic' and 'benthic foraging' dives. All the 'benthic foraging' dives occurred in Area 3 (defined by water-temperature data as lying over the Antarctic Continental Shelf) and were 400-500 m deep. 'Pelagic foraging' dives occurred in all three foraging areas and ranged in depth from 200 to 1100 m. These types of dives also exhibited marked diurnal variations in depth, unlike 'benthic foraging' dives. The seals spent 10-20 min at the bottom of each 'foraging' dive, where they generally displayed a series of small changes in depth (wiggles). The size of these 'wiggles' tended to be larger in 'pelagic foraging' dives than in 'benthic foraging' dives. The diving behaviour of southern elephant seals is related to the possible prey they exploit in the Southern Ocean.<\/jats:p>",

These observations confirm that koalas may show individual differences in the species of food trees they prefer. E. viminalis, the preferred species of this population, was the predominant tree species within the home range of 15 of the koalas, which may account for the lack of evidence of preference in the majority of animals.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>The southern elephant seal population at Macquarie Island has undergone a serious decline since regular surveys were commenced in 1949. Approximately 2,900 cows and 250 bulls were counted in the isthmus study area during the 1985 breeding season. Comparisons with 20 other counts made in the same area between 1949 and 1984 showed that, although there was considerable fluctuation between the years, the number of seals ashore has dropped at an average rate of 2.1% per year, resulting in a net decrease of approximately 50% for both males and females. This is similar to the ratio of decline of elephant seal populations in the southern Indian Ocean. The census information from all major elephant seal populations was reviewed and it was concluded that there may be a common factor, or group of factors, acting to reduce the Macquarie Island and Indian Ocean populations, while the populations of the South Atlantic seem to be stable. Several potential explanations for these observations are advanced, but it is concluded that a greater knowledge of the ecology of the seals is needed if the declines are to be understood.<\/jats:p>",

One of the rarest pinnipeds, the New Zealand sea lion (NZSL, <jats:italic>Phocarctos hookeri<\/jats:italic>) has a very restricted breeding range. At Campbell Island/Motu Ihupuku, one of the two primary breeding sites, at‐sea foraging behaviour is unknown. We hypothesised that NZSL of various sex and age classes would utilise the water column differently due to differing physiological constraints and therefore have different accessibility to prey resources. We tested whether sea lion diving behaviour varied in relation to (i) age and sex class, (ii) time of day and (iii) water depth. We also hypothesised that the proportion of benthic/pelagic diving, and consequently risk of fisheries interaction, would vary in relation to age and sex. Satellite telemetry tags were deployed on 25 NZSL from a range of age/sex classes recording dive depth, duration and location. Adult females and juveniles used inshore, benthic habitats, while sub‐adult males also utilised benthic habitats, they predominantly used pelagic habitat at greater distances from the island. Adult females and juveniles exhibited shorter dives than the same age/sex classes at the Auckland Islands, suggesting a lower dive effort for these age/sex classes at Campbell Island/Motu Ihupuku. Adult females dived more frequently than other age/sex classes, likely operating closer to their physiological limits; however, further data for this age class is needed. Sub‐adult male use of pelagic prey may increase their exposure to mid‐water trawls; however, further research detailing the degree of spatial overlap with fisheries is required. This study highlights the utility of spatially explicit dive data to predict vertical habitat use, niche separation of various age and sex classes of marine predators and attribute potential fisheries interaction risk in relation to predator habitat use.<\/jats:p>",

We characterise the foraging behaviour of 308 trips taken by 96 shy albatross (<jats:italic>Thalassarche cauta<\/jats:italic>) from Albatross Island across seven consecutive years. At a population level, incubating shy albatross exploited a consistent area within ca. 500 km radius of their breeding colony. During half of the trips, individuals utilised the closest shelf break to the west of the colony, where upwelling events have been reported. The other half of the trips were exclusively within the neritic zone, utilising a variety of locations within the Bass Strait. Furthermore, we found evidence of individual consistency to geographic locations, with subsequent trips by an individual more similar than random trips from all individuals in our data, both within and between years (<jats:italic>G<\/jats:italic>‐test, <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic> &lt; .05). Between‐individual variation in foraging behaviour was not meaningfully explained by age (linear regression, <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic> &gt; .05) or sex (<jats:italic>t<\/jats:italic>‐test, <jats:italic>p<\/jats:italic> &gt; .05) for any metric, suggesting that other intrinsic individual factors are accounting for between‐individual variation in foraging trips. A localised foraging distribution is unusual for albatross, which, combined with high variation in space use between individuals demonstrated here, suggests that this species is accessing adequate resources near the colony. Overall, these findings suggest that incubating shy albatross from Albatross Island exhibit tendencies of a generalist population comprised of uniquely specialised individuals. These results suggest that this species is operating below its biological capacity in this fast‐warming area and provide a baseline from which to assess future change.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>In Tasmania, Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus) regularly interact with Atlantic salmon (Salmo salmar L.) aquaculture lease operations and opportunistically consume fish. The microbial communities of seals and aquaculture salmon were analyzed for potential indicators of microbial sharing and to determine the potential effects of interactions on wild seal microbiome composition. The high-throughput sequencing of the V1–V3 region of the 16S rRNA genes from the gut microbial communities of 221 fur seals was performed: 41 males caught at farms, 50 adult scats from haul-outs near farms, 24 necropsied seals, and controls from Bass Strait breeding colonies, encompassing 56 adult scats and 50 pup swabs. QIIME2 and R Studio were used for analysis. Foraging at or near salmon farms significantly shifted seal microbiome biodiversity. Taxonomic analysis showed a greater divergence in Bacteroidota representatives in male seals captured at farms compared to all other groups. Pathogens were identified that could be monitoring targets. Potential indicator amplicon sequence variants were found across a variety of taxa and could be used as minimally invasive indicators for interactions at this interface. The diversity and taxonomic shifts in the microbial communities of seals indicate a need to further study this interface for broader ecological implications.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Anthropogenic climate change is resulting in spatial redistributions of many species. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on an abundant and widely distributed group of diving birds, <jats:italic>Eudyptes<\/jats:italic> penguins, which are the main avian consumers in the Southern Ocean in terms of biomass consumption. Despite their abundance, several of these species have undergone population declines over the past century, potentially due to changing oceanography and prey availability over the important winter months. We used light‐based geolocation tracking data for 485 individuals deployed between 2006 and 2020 across 10 of the major breeding locations for five taxa of <jats:italic>Eudyptes<\/jats:italic> penguins. We used boosted regression tree modelling to quantify post‐moult habitat preference for southern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. chrysocome<\/jats:italic>), eastern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. filholi<\/jats:italic>), northern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. moseleyi<\/jats:italic>) and macaroni/royal (<jats:italic>E. chrysolophus<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>E. schlegeli<\/jats:italic>) penguins. We then modelled their redistribution under two climate change scenarios, representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (for the end of the century, 2071–2100). As climate forcings differ regionally, we quantified redistribution in the Atlantic, Central Indian, East Indian, West Pacific and East Pacific regions. We found sea surface temperature and sea surface height to be the most important predictors of current habitat for these penguins; physical features that are changing rapidly in the Southern Ocean. Our results indicated that the less severe RCP4.5 would lead to less habitat loss than the more severe RCP8.5. The five taxa of penguin may experience a general poleward redistribution of their preferred habitat, but with contrasting effects in the (i) change in total area of preferred habitat under climate change (ii) according to geographic region and (iii) the species (macaroni/royal vs. rockhopper populations). Our results provide further understanding on the regional impacts and vulnerability of species to climate change.<\/jats:p>",

However, a greater understanding of how species are responding to change over large spatial and temporal scales are required—particularly at high latitudes such as the Southern Ocean. We examined black-browed Thalassarche melanophris (BBAL) and light-mantled sooty Phoebetria palpebrata albatross (LMSA) observations spanning over 50 years. Both species have a wide-ranging distribution in a rapidly changing Southern Ocean. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to investigate environmental drivers of their abundance and occurrence. Our results show that climate indices, sea surface temperature and sea surface height are the main drivers influencing the distribution and abundance of both species. The abundance of BBAL southeast of Australia was observed to be decreased substantially whereas no significant change was observed in the abundance of LMSA. Both species demonstrated contrasting distributions along their latitudinal gradient with BBAL showing early stages of a southward range shift. Our analyses suggest that responses to climate change are species-specific. These rare, long-term data have provided an understanding of species’ responses to past changes in the marine environment and can provide critical information for future conservation and management.<\/jats:p>",

Critical marine ecosystem services include maintenance of global oxygen and carbon cycles, production of food and energy, and sustenance of human wellbeing. However marine ecosystems are swiftly being degraded due to the unsustainable use of marine environments and a rapidly changing climate. The fundamental challenge for the future is therefore to safeguard marine ecosystem biodiversity, function, and adaptive capacity whilst continuing to provide vital resources for the global population. Here, we use foresighting/hindcasting to consider two plausible futures towards 2030: a business-as-usual trajectory (i.e. continuation of current trends), and a more sustainable but technically achievable future in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals. We identify key drivers that differentiate these alternative futures and use these to develop an action pathway towards the desirable, more sustainable future. Key to achieving the more sustainable future will be establishing integrative (i.e. across jurisdictions and sectors), adaptive management that supports equitable and sustainable stewardship of marine environments. Conserving marine ecosystems will require recalibrating our social, financial, and industrial relationships with the marine environment. While a sustainable future requires long-term planning and commitment beyond 2030, immediate action is needed to avoid tipping points and avert trajectories of ecosystem decline. By acting now to optimise management and protection of marine ecosystems, building upon existing technologies, and conserving the remaining biodiversity, we can create the best opportunity for a sustainable future in 2030 and beyond.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mechanisms promoting coexistence between closely related species are fundamental for maintaining species diversity. Mechanisms of niche differentiation include allochrony which offsets the peak timing of resource utilisation between species. Many studies focus on spatial and temporal niche partitioning during the breeding season, few have investigated the role allochrony plays in influencing interspecific segregation of foraging distribution and ecology between congeneric species during the non-breeding season. We investigated the non-breeding migrations of Snares (<jats:italic>Eudyptes robustus<\/jats:italic>) and Fiordland penguins (<jats:italic>Eudyptes pachyrhynchus<\/jats:italic>), closely related species breeding between 100–350 km apart whose migration phenology differs by two months. Using light geolocation tracking, we examined the degree of overlap given the observed allochrony and a hypothetical scenario where the species commence migration simultaneously. We found that Fiordland penguins migrated to the Sub-Antarctic Frontal Zone and Polar Frontal Zone in the austral autumn whereas Snares penguins disperse westwards staying north of the Sub-Tropical Front in the austral winter. Our results suggest that allochrony is likely to be at the root of segregation because the relative profitability of the different water masses that the penguins forage in changes seasonally which results in the two species utilising different areas over their core non-breeding periods. Furthermore, allochrony reduces relatively higher levels of spatiotemporal overlap during the departure and arrival periods, when the close proximity of the two species’ colonies would cause the birds to congregate in similar areas, resulting in high interspecific competition just before the breeding season. Available evidence from other studies suggests that the shift in phenology between these species has arisen from adaptive radiation and phenological matching to the seasonality of local resource availability during the breeding season and reduced competitive overlap over the non-breeding season is likely to be an incidental outcome.<\/jats:p>",

Here, we review and synthesize published reports of climate adaptation interventions for iconic fauna. We present a systematic map of peer‐reviewed literature databases (Web of Science and Scopus); however, only nine climate adaptation actions targeting iconic fauna were returned. In the grey and informal literature, there were many instances of practical intervention within our scope, that were not uncovered during traditional systematic search methods. The richness of actions reported in commercial news, government and non‐government organization media outlets and other online sources vastly outweighs the limited studies that have been robustly evaluated and reported in the scientific literature. From our investigation of this emerging field of conservation practice, we draw insights and pen a series of recommendations for the field moving forward. Key recommendations for future adaptation interventions include: the sharing and publishing of climate‐related conservation interventions, the use of standardized metrics for reporting outcomes, the implementation of experimental controls for any actions undertaken, and reporting and evaluation of both failures and successes.<\/jats:p>",

This study provides the first description of the acoustic repertoire of the crabeater seal in East Antarctica, using data from a stationary hydrophone at 1.8 km depth in the Southern Kerguelen Plateau region in 2014–2015. Two call types were identified in the data set: the low and the high moan calls. Of the 8821 calls detected, 92.5% were classified as low moan calls and 7.5% were high moan calls. The mean duration of the two call types was similar (2.3 and 2.8 s, respectively), however, the high moan calls had a higher frequency range (1020–4525 Hz, n = 11) than the low moan calls (360–2753 Hz, n = 120). The calls were primarily detected in the austral spring. Diel analysis showed that the low moan calls were mostly made at nighttime or proximal to dusk and dawn. The results of this study could aid in the development of automated detectors for crabeater seal vocalizations. This would facilitate comparisons of the distribution and abundance of the species using extant acoustic data and could increase knowledge on the breeding behavior of crabeater seals.<\/jats:p>",

Understanding the relative influence and compounding nature of marine and terrestrial threats on the demography of seabird communities is vital for evidence-based conservation. Using 20 years of capture-mark-recapture data from four sympatric species of albatross (black-browed<jats:italic>Thalassarche melanophris<\/jats:italic>, gray-headed<jats:italic>T. chrysostoma<\/jats:italic>, light-mantled<jats:italic>Phoebetria palpebrata<\/jats:italic>and wandering<jats:italic>Diomedea exulans<\/jats:italic>) at subantarctic Macquarie Island, we quantified the temporal variability in survival, breeding probability and success. In three species (excluding the wandering albatross because of their small population), we also assessed the influence of fisheries, oceanographic and terrestrial change on these rates. The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) explained 20.87–29.38% of the temporal variability in survival in all three species and 22.72–28.60% in breeding success for black-browed and gray-headed albatross, with positive SAM events related to higher success. The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) Index explained 21.14–44.04% of the variability in survival, with higher survival rates following La Niña events. For black-browed albatrosses, effort in south-west Atlantic longline fisheries had a negative relationship with survival and explained 22.75–32.21% of the variability. Whereas increased effort in New Zealand trawl fisheries were related to increases in survival, explaining 21.26–28.29 % of variability. The inclusion of terrestrial covariates, reflecting extreme rainfall events and rabbit-driven habitat degradation, explained greater variability in trends breeding probability than oceanographic or fisheries covariates for all three species. These results indicate managing drivers of demographic trends that are most easily controlled, such as fisheries and habitat degradation, will be a viable option for some species (e.g., black-browed albatross) but less effective for others (e.g., light-mantled albatross). Our results illustrate the need to integrate fisheries, oceanographic and terrestrial processes when assessing demographic variability and formulating the appropriate management response.<\/jats:p>",

Events such as marine heatwaves result in an anomalous change in the physical environment, which can lead to shifts in the structure, biomass, and distribution of lower trophic levels. As central‐place foragers, seabirds are vulnerable to changes in their foraging grounds during the breeding season. We first quantified spatiotemporal variability in the occurrence and biomass of prey in response to an abrupt change in oceanography as a result of a marine heatwave event. Secondly, using multivariate techniques and machine learning, we investigated if differences in the foraging technique and prey of seabirds resulted in varying responses to changes in prey occurrence and the environment over a 2.5‐yr period. We found that the main variables correlated with seabird distribution were also important in structuring the occurrence and biomass of prey; sea‐surface temperature (SST), current speed, mixed‐layer depth, and bathymetry. Both zooplankton biomass and the occurrence of fish schools exhibited negative relationships with temperature, and temperature was subsequently an important variable in determining seabird distribution. We were able to establish correlations between the distribution of prey and the spatiotemporal distribution of albatross, little penguins and common‐diving petrels. We were unable to find a correlation between the distribution of prey and that of short‐tailed shearwaters and fairy prions. For high‐use coastal areas, the delineation of important foraging regions is essential to balance human use of an area with the needs of marine predators, particularly seabirds.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>The sustainable mitigation of human–wildlife conflicts has become a major societal and environmental challenge globally. Among these conflicts, large marine predators feeding on fisheries catches, a behaviour termed “depredation,” has emerged concomitantly with the expansion of the world’s fisheries. Depredation poses threats to both the socio‐economic viability of fisheries and species conservation, stressing the need for mitigation. This review synthesizes the extent and socio‐ecological impacts of depredation by sharks and marine mammals across the world, and the various approaches used to minimize it. Depredation was reported in 214 fisheries between 1979 and 2019 (70% post‐2000) and affected fleets from 44 countries, in all sectors (commercial, artisanal and recreational), and in all major fishing techniques (nets, traps and hook‐and‐lines). A total of 68 predator species were involved in depredation (20 odontocetes, 21 pinnipeds and 27 sharks), and most (73%) were subject to either by‐catch and/or retaliatory killing from fishers when interacting with gear. Impacts on fishers were primarily associated with catch losses and gear damage but often lacked assessments. Deterrence was a major mitigation approach but also the least effective. Gear modifications or behavioural adaptation by fishers were more promising. This review highlights the need for improved monitoring, and interdisciplinary and integrated research to quantify the determinants and impacts of depredation in the socio‐ecological dimension. More importantly, as the conflict is likely to escalate, efforts directed towards changing perceptions and integrating knowledge through adaptive co‐management are raised as key directions towards coexistence between fisheries and large marine predators.<\/jats:p>",

Temporal variability in rabbit density explained 33–76% of the variability in breeding probability for all three species, with severe decreases in breeding probability observed after a lag period following highest rabbit numbers. For black-browed albatrosses, the combination of extreme rainfall and high rabbit density explained 33% of total trait variability and dramatically reduced breeding success. We showed that invasive rabbits and extreme weather events reduce reproductive output in albatrosses and that eliminating rabbits had a positive effect on albatross reproduction. This illustrates how active animal management at a local breeding site can result in positive population outcomes even for wide ranging animals like albatrosses where influencing vital rates during their at-sea migrations is more challenging.<\/jats:p>",

RAATD consolidated tracking data for multiple species of Antarctic meso- and top-predators to identify Areas of Ecological Significance. These datasets and accompanying syntheses provide a greater understanding of fundamental ecosystem processes in the Southern Ocean, support modelling of predator distributions under future climate scenarios and create inputs that can be incorporated into decision making processes by management authorities. In this data paper, we present the compiled tracking data from research groups that have worked in the Antarctic since the 1990s. The data are publicly available through biodiversity.aq and the Ocean Biogeographic Information System. The archive includes tracking data from over 70 contributors across 12 national Antarctic programs, and includes data from 17 predator species, 4060 individual animals, and over 2.9 million observed locations.<\/jats:p>",

Individuals are expected to adjust their foraging movements to the hierarchical spatial distribution of resources. At a small local scale, spatial segregation in foraging habitat happens among individuals of closely situated colonies. If foraging segregation is due to differences in distribution of resources, we would expect segregated foraging areas to have divergent habitat characteristics.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We investigated how environmental characteristics of preferred foraging areas differ between two closely situated Subantarctic fur seal (<jats:italic>Arctocephalus tropicalis<\/jats:italic>) colonies and a single Antarctic fur seal (<jats:italic>A. gazella<\/jats:italic>) colony that forage in different pelagic areas even though they are located well within each other’s foraging range. We further investigated the influence of the seasonal cycle on those environmental factors. This study used tracking data from 121 adult female Subantarctic and Antarctic fur seals, collected during summer and winter (2009–2015), from three different colonies. Boosted Regression Tree species distribution models were used to determine key environmental variables associated with areas of fur seal restricted search behaviour. There were no differences in the relative influence of key environmental variables between colonies and seasons. The variables with the most influence for each colony and season were latitude, longitude and magnitude of sea-currents. The influence of latitude and longitude is a by-product of the species’ distinct foraging areas, despite the close proximity (&lt; 25 km) of the colonies. The predicted potential foraging areas for each colony changed from summer to winter, reflecting the seasonal cycle of the Southern Ocean. The model predicted that the potential foraging areas of females from the three colonies should overlap, and the fact they do not in reality indicates that factors other than environmental are influencing the location of each colony’s foraging area.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>\n              <jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Conclusions<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The results indicated that small scale spatial segregation of foraging habitats is not driven by bottom-up processes. It is therefore important to also consider other potential drivers, e.g. competition, information transfer, and memory, to understand animal foraging decisions and movements.<\/jats:p>\n              <\/jats:sec>",

This fundamentally limits access by researchers to critical parts of pinniped life history and has spurred the development and implementation of a variety of externally attached telemetry devices (ETDs) to collect information about movement patterns, physiology and ecology of marine animals when they cannot be directly observed. ETDs are less invasive and easier to apply than implanted internal devices, making them more widely used. However, ETDs have limited retention times and their use may result in negative short- and long-term consequences including capture myopathy, impacts to energetics, behavior, and entanglement risk. We identify 15 best practice recommendations for the use of ETDs with pinnipeds that address experimental justification, animal capture, tag design, tag attachment, effects assessments, preparation, and reporting. Continued improvement of best practices is critical within the framework of the Three Rs (Reduction, Refinement, Replacement); these best practice recommendations provide current guidance to mitigate known potential negative outcomes for individuals and local populations. These recommendations were developed specifically for pinnipeds; however, they may also be applicable to studies of other marine taxa. We conclude with four desired future directions for the use of ETDs in technology development, validation studies, experimental designs and data sharing.<\/jats:p>",

The extent, trends and underlying mechanisms driving these interactions remain poorly known. Using long-term (2003–2017) datasets from seven major Patagonian toothfish (<jats:italic>Dissostichus eleginoides<\/jats:italic>) longline fisheries, this study assessed the levels and inter-annual trends of sperm whale (<jats:italic>Physeter macrocephalus<\/jats:italic>) and/or killer whale (<jats:italic>Orcinus orca<\/jats:italic>) interactions as proportions of fishing time (days) and fishing area (spatial cells). The role of fishing patterns in explaining between-fisheries variations of probabilities of odontocete interactions was investigated. While interaction levels remained globally stable since the early 2000s, they varied greatly between fisheries from 0 to &gt;50% of the fishing days and area. Interaction probabilities were influenced by the seasonal concentration of fishing effort, size of fishing areas, density of vessels, their mobility and the depth at which they operated. The results suggest that between-fisheries variations of interaction probabilities are largely explained by the extent to which vessels provide whales with opportunities for interactions. Determining the natural distribution of whales will, therefore, allow fishers to implement better strategies of spatio-temporal avoidance of depredation.<\/jats:p>",

We used satellite-telemetered movement and diving data to investigate differential migration and its ontogeny in a highly migratory North Pacific Ocean predator, the northern fur seal (<jats:italic>Callorhinus ursinus<\/jats:italic>; NFS), with a focus on understudied juvenile (1- to 2-year-old) animals. We instrumented 71 juvenile NFS in two years (2006–07 and 2007–08) at three major North American breeding sites and compared their migratory strategies with pups and adults. Although sexual dimorphism is strong in adult NFS, only weak differences in body mass between sexes were found in juveniles, which had similar body mass to pups (~3–4 months). However, unlike widely-dispersed pups, juvenile male and female NFS dispersed in different directions, and used different habitats characterized by distinct hydrography and prey assemblages during migration, similar to breeding adults. Juvenile diving behavior differed only modestly among habitats and between sexes, consistent with weak differences in body mass. Evidence of habitat sexual segregation by juvenile NFS contradicts previous hypotheses that physiological differences predominantly drive the ontogeny of differential migration.<\/jats:p>",

While power analyses can inform sample sizes needed for statistical significance, they require some initial data inputs that are often unavailable. To inform the planning of telemetry and biologging studies of marine megafauna where few or no data are available or where resources are limited, we reviewed the types of information that have been obtained in previously published studies using different sample sizes. We considered sample sizes from one to &gt;100 individuals and synthesized empirical findings, detailing the information that can be gathered with increasing sample sizes. We complement this review with simulations, using real data, to show the impact of sample size when trying to address various research questions in movement ecology of marine megafauna. We also highlight the value of collaborative, synthetic studies to enhance sample sizes and broaden the range, scale, and scope of questions that can be answered.<\/jats:p>",

The gillnet mimic was made up of gillnet material configured as a series of vertical lines 25 mm apart stretched tightly across a stainless steel frame that measured 1160 mm × 1540 mm and divided into two equal panel areas. The panels were placed in a large tank within an enclosure that housed 25 penguins. Penguins were able to readily access the tank and swim freely. The frame was always introduced into the tank with one panel containing a gillnet mimic, and the other panel left empty as a control.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Gillnet filament colours tested were clear, green and orange.

We found that movement patterns of marine megafauna are mostly independent of their evolutionary histories, differing significantly from patterns for terrestrial animals. We detected a remarkable convergence in the distribution of speed and turning angles across organisms ranging from whales to turtles (epitome for the slowest animals on land but not at sea). Marine megafauna show a prevalence of movement patterns dominated by search behavior in coastal habitats compared with more directed, ballistic movement patterns when the animals move across the open ocean. The habitats through which they move will therefore need to be considered for effective conservation.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Over the past five decades, marine mammal interactions with fisheries have become a major human-wildlife conflict globally. The emergence of longline fishing is concomitant with the development of depredation-type interactions i.e., marine mammals feeding on fish caught on hooks. The killer whale (<jats:italic>Orcinus orca<\/jats:italic>) is one of the species most involved in depredation on longline fisheries. The issue was first reported in high latitudes but, with increasing expansion of this fishing method, other fisheries have begun to experience interactions. The present study investigated killer whale interactions with two geographically isolated blue-eye trevalla (<jats:italic>Hyperoglyphe antarctica<\/jats:italic>) fisheries operating in temperate waters off Amsterdam/St. Paul Islands (Indian Ocean) and south-eastern Australia. These two fisheries differ in the fishing technique used (vertical<jats:italic>vs.<\/jats:italic>demersal longlines), effort, catch, fleet size and fishing area size. Using 7-year (2010–16) long fishing and observation datasets, this study estimated the levels of killer whale interactions and examined the influence of spatio-temporal and operational variables on the probability of vessels to experience interactions. Killer whales interactions occurred during 58.4% and 21.2% of all fishing days, and over 94% and 47.4% of the fishing area for both fisheries, respectively. In south-eastern Australia, the probability of occurrence of killer whale interactions during fishing days varied seasonally with a decrease in spring, increased with the daily fishing effort and decreased with the distance travelled by the vessel between fishing days. In Amsterdam/St. Paul, this probability was only influenced by latitude, with an increase in the southern part of the area. Together, these findings document two previously unreported cases of high killer whale depredation, and provide insights on ways to avoid the issue. The study also emphasizes the need to further examine the local characteristics of fisheries and the ecology of local depredating killer whale populations in as important drivers of depredation.<\/jats:p>",

We have identified a remarkable example of a transhemispheric macrosystem spanning 15,000 kilometers of the Pacific Ocean maintained by a migratory species of seabird that nests in the South Pacific and winters in the North Pacific. It highlights another example in a growing list of ecosystem disservices of an abundant species of North Pacific salmon, and the need to include ecosystem processes at such geographic scales in conservation and management considerations for this northern open ocean.<\/jats:p>",

We use species habitat models to predict the winter foraging habitats of female southern elephant seals and investigate how changes in environmental variables within these habitats may be related to observed decreases in the Macquarie Island population. There were three main groups of seals that specialized in different ocean realms (the sub‐Antarctic, the Ross Sea and the Victoria Land Coast). The physical and climate attributes (e.g. wind strength, sea surface height, ocean current strength) varied amongst the realms and also displayed different temporal trends over the last two to four decades. Most notably, sea ice extent increased on average in the Victoria Land realm while it decreased overall in the Ross Sea realm. Using a species distribution model relating mean residence times (time spent in each 50 × 50 km grid cell) to 9 climate and physical co‐variates, we developed spatial predictions of residence time to identify the core regions used by the seals across the Southern Ocean from 120°E to 120°W. Population size at Macquarie Island was negatively correlated with ice concentration within the core habitat of seals using the Victoria Land Coast and the Ross Sea. Sea ice extent and concentration is predicted to continue to change in the Southern Ocean, having unknown consequences for the biota of the region. The proportion of Macquarie Island females (40%) utilizing the relatively stable sub‐Antarctic region, may buffer this population against longer‐term regional changes in habitat quality, but the Macquarie Island population has persistently decreased (−1.45% per annum) over seven decades indicating that environmental changes in the Antarctic are acting on the remaining 60% of the population to impose a long‐term population decline in a top Southern Ocean predator.<\/jats:p>",

However, the diets of key predator groups like seabirds have conventionally been assessed from stomach content analyses, which cannot detect most gelatinous prey. As marine top predators are used to identify changes in the overall species composition of marine ecosystems, such biases in dietary assessment may impact our detection of important ecosystem regime shifts. We investigated albatross diet using <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> metabarcoding of scats to assess the prevalence of gelatinous zooplankton consumption by two albatross species, one of which is used as an indicator species for ecosystem monitoring. Black‐browed and Campbell albatross scats were collected from eight breeding colonies covering the circumpolar range of these birds over two consecutive breeding seasons. Fish was the main dietary item at most sites; however, cnidarian <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content>, primarily from scyphozoan jellyfish, was present in 42% of samples overall and up to 80% of samples at some sites. Jellyfish was detected during all breeding stages and consumed by adults and chicks. Trawl fishery catches of jellyfish near the Falkland Islands indicate a similar frequency of jellyfish occurrence in albatross diets in years of high and low jellyfish availability, suggesting jellyfish consumption may be selective rather than opportunistic. Warmer oceans and overfishing of finfish are predicted to favour jellyfish population increases, and we demonstrate here that dietary <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> metabarcoding enables measurements of the contribution of gelatinous zooplankton to the diet of marine predators.<\/jats:p>",

A variety of molecular approaches can be used to recover dietary <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> from scats; however, many of these also recover non‐food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content>. Blocking primers can be used to inhibit amplification of some non‐target <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content>, but this may not always be feasible, especially when multiple distinct non‐target groups are present.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>We have developed scat collection protocols to optimise the detection of food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> in vertebrate scat samples. Using shy albatross <jats:italic>Thalassarche cauta<\/jats:italic> as a case study, we investigated how <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> amplification success and the proportion of food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> detected are influenced by both environmental and physiological parameters. We show that both the amount and type of non‐target <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> vary with sample freshness, the collection substrate, fasting period and developmental stage of the consumer.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Fresh scat samples yielded the highest proportion of food sequences. Collecting scats from dirt substrates reduced the proportion of food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> and increased the proportion of contaminating <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content>. Food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> detection rates changed throughout the albatross breeding season and related to the time since feeding and the developmental stage of the animal. Fasting albatross produced scats dominated by parasite amplicons in universal <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">PCR<\/jats:styled-content> analysis, with little food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> recovered. Samples from very young animals also produced reduced food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> proportions.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n\n<jats:list-item><jats:p>Based on our observations, we recommend the following procedures for field scat collections to ensure high‐quality samples for dietary <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> metabarcoding studies. Ideally, (i) collect fresh scats; (ii) from surfaces with minimal contamination (e.g. rock or ice); (iii) collect scats from animals with minimum time since feeding and avoid fasting animals; (iv) avoid young animals that are not feeding directly (e.g. not weaned or fledged) or target larger/older individuals. The optimised field sampling protocols that we describe will improve the quality of dietary data from vertebrates by focusing on samples most likely to contain food <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content>. They will also help minimise contamination issues from non‐target <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">DNA<\/jats:styled-content> and provide standardised field methods in this rapidly expanding area of research.<\/jats:p><\/jats:list-item>\n<\/jats:list>\n<\/jats:p>",

Understanding their prey requirements and dietary flexibility in this context is important for effective conservation and management. However, changes in the methods used to assess diet, as well as the spatial and temporal coverage of monitoring schemes, may reduce our ability to detect and monitor these marine threats. To help assess conservation priorities linked to diet, we performed a systematic review of 109 albatross diet papers published between 1950 and 2016, which corresponded to 296 studies when stratified by sampling year, breeding site, and breeding species. We assessed the methods used, changes over time, and spatial and temporal sampling coverage by species and island group. Most albatross studies have focused on chick-rearing, and diet during other breeding phases is comparatively poorly known. Furthermore, chicks are more commonly sampled than adults and very rarely immature birds, all of which may differ in diet composition. There was a pronounced shift over time in the preferred method of characterising diet, from the morphological examination of prey remains to stable isotope analysis of tissue. This shift has reduced the volume of detailed taxonomic information available from morphological studies. This difference in resolution hinders the ability to detect changes in prey species, with implications for management of threatened albatrosses and for monitoring broader changes in marine ecosystems. In a knowledge gap analysis for important breeding colonies (with &amp;gt;5% of global population), we identified key sites where existing monitoring has provided a foundation for robust longitudinal diet studies. Maintaining and augmenting these long-term research programmes will enable analyses of the impacts of changing climate and fishing practices on seabird populations and facilitate the timely identification and implementation of management options.<\/jats:p>",

We used two decades of telemetry data from the East Antarctic sector of the Southern Ocean.

The regional predictions from these models were combined to identify areas utilized by multiple species, and therefore likely to be of particular ecological significance. These areas were distributed across the longitudinal breadth of the East Antarctic sector, and were characterized by proximity to breeding colonies, both on the Antarctic continent and on subantarctic islands to the north, and by sea‐ice dynamics, particularly locations of winter polynyas. These areas of important habitat were also congruent with many of the areas reported to be showing the strongest regional trends in sea ice seasonality. The results emphasize the importance of on‐shore and sea‐ice processes to Antarctic marine ecosystems. Our study provides ocean‐basin‐scale predictions of predator habitat utilization, an assessment of contemporary habitat use against which future changes can be assessed, and is of direct relevance to current conservation planning and spatial management efforts.<\/jats:p>",

We review the major threats to polar ecosystems including the principal stressor, climate change, which interacts with and exacerbates other threats such as pollution, fisheries overexploitation, and the establishment and spread of invasive species. Given the lack of progress in reducing global atmospheric greenhouse‐gas emissions, we suggest that managing the threats that interact synergistically with climate change, and that are potentially more tractable, is all the more important in the short to medium term for polar conservation. We show how evidence‐based lessons learned from scientific research can be shared between the poles on topics such as contaminant mitigation, biosecurity protocols to reduce species invasions, and the regulation of fisheries and marine environments. Applying these trans‐polar lessons in tandem with expansion of international cooperation could substantially improve environmental management in both the Arctic and Antarctic.<\/jats:p>",

This article reviews current and expected changes in <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ASO<\/jats:styled-content> physical habitats in response to climate change. It then reviews how these changes may impact the autecology of marine biota of this polar region: microbes, zooplankton, salps, Antarctic krill, fish, cephalopods, marine mammals, seabirds, and benthos. The general prognosis for <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">ASO<\/jats:styled-content> marine habitats is for an overall warming and freshening, strengthening of westerly winds, with a potential pole‐ward movement of those winds and the frontal systems, and an increase in ocean eddy activity. Many habitat parameters will have regionally specific changes, particularly relating to sea ice characteristics and seasonal dynamics. Lower trophic levels are expected to move south as the ocean conditions in which they are currently found move pole‐ward. For Antarctic krill and finfish, the latitudinal breadth of their range will depend on their tolerance of warming oceans and changes to productivity. Ocean acidification is a concern not only for calcifying organisms but also for crustaceans such as Antarctic krill; it is also likely to be the most important change in benthic habitats over the coming century. For marine mammals and birds, the expected changes primarily relate to their flexibility in moving to alternative locations for food and the energetic cost of longer or more complex foraging trips for those that are bound to breeding colonies. Few species are sufficiently well studied to make comprehensive species‐specific vulnerability assessments possible. Priorities for future work are discussed.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Since 1975, northern fur seal (<jats:italic>Callorhinus ursinus<\/jats:italic>) numbers at the Pribilof Islands (PI) in the Bering Sea have declined rapidly for unknown reasons. Migratory dispersal and habitat choice may affect first-year survivorship, thereby contributing to this decline. We compared migratory behaviour of 166 naive pups during 2 years from islands with disparate population trends (increasing: Bogoslof and San Miguel Islands; declining: PI), hypothesizing that climatic conditions at weaning may differentially affect dispersal and survival. Atmospheric conditions (Bering Sea) in autumn 2005–2006 were anomalously cold, while 2006–2007 was considerably warmer and less stormy. In 2005, pups departed earlier at all sites, and the majority of PI pups (68–85%) departed within 1 day of Arctic storms and dispersed quickly, travelling southwards through the Aleutian Islands. Tailwinds enabled faster rates of travel than headwinds, a trend not previously shown for marine mammals. Weather effects were less pronounced at Bogoslof Island (approx. 400 km further south), and, at San Miguel Island, (California) departures were more gradual, and only influenced by wind and air pressure in 2005. We suggest that increasingly variable climatic conditions at weaning, particularly timing, frequency and intensity of autumnal storms in the Bering Sea, may alter timing, direction of dispersal and potentially survival of pups.<\/jats:p>",

The continuous‐time formulation allows data that have been nonuniformly collected over time to be modeled without subsampling, interpolation, or aggregation to obtain a set of locations uniformly spaced in time. The model is derived from a continuous‐time Ornstein‐Uhlenbeck velocity process that is integrated to form a location process. The continuous‐time model was placed into a state–space framework to allow parameter estimation and location predictions from observed animal locations. Two previously unpublished marine mammal telemetry data sets were analyzed to illustrate use of the model, by‐products available from the analysis, and different modifications which are possible. A harbor seal data set was analyzed with a model that incorporates the proportion of each hour spent on land. Also, a northern fur seal pup data set was analyzed with a random drift component to account for directed travel and ocean currents.<\/jats:p>",

A multivariate analysis of the environmental parameters at each of the nightly foraging locations indicated the existence of two ecoregions within the foraging range of the seals. Five seals actively foraged in oceanic waters (1870 m) with relatively warm surface water (5.4°C) to the north and east of the colony (ecoregion 1), while four others travelled to the southeast (ecoregion 2) to waters typical of the surface expression of the Polar Front (3.7°C) located over the continental shelf break (597 m). Only one seal foraged in both regions. Diving behaviour, parameterised on a nightly basis using seven variables, clearly differed between regions, with the diving activity in the warmer ecoregion 1 being characterised by deep dives (55 m), and relatively little time spent diving (47%). Conversely, dives within ecoregion 2 were, on average, to shallower depths (34.5 m), and proportionately more time was spent diving (54%). Despite differences in environmental conditions encountered and associated differences in diving activity, the foraging success of mothers, in terms of daily pup mass gain per foraging cycle, was similar in both ecoregions. The study highlights the use of multivariate analysis in categorising the foraging zones and behaviour of Antarctic fur seals.<\/jats:p>",

HTO\nblood samples were analysed using two distillation methods (direct serum\ncounts and evaporative freeze capture) that yielded significantly different\nestimates.

There were significant,\npositive relationships between TBW and BIA variables, but the level of\naccuracy was inadequate for BIA to be more useful than the other methods\ntrialled. Morphometric models accurately estimated TBW (kg). Models developed\nfrom surface area (SA) (TBW = [SA * 82.58] – 86.94)\nand from a combination of mass (M), length (L), and girth (G) (TBW =\n[(M * 0.72) + (L * 5.49) + (G\n* 134.94) + 164.36)] provided the most accurate TBW estimates.\nIn contrast, condition indices did not give accurate or reliable estimates of\nrelative body condition.<\/jats:p>",

However, a greater understanding of how species are responding to change over large spatial and temporal scales are required—particularly at high latitudes such as the Southern Ocean. We examined black-browed Thalassarche melanophris (BBAL) and light-mantled sooty Phoebetria palpebrata albatross (LMSA) observations spanning over 50 years. Both species have a wide-ranging distribution in a rapidly changing Southern Ocean. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to investigate environmental drivers of their abundance and occurrence. Our results show that climate indices, sea surface temperature and sea surface height are the main drivers influencing the distribution and abundance of both species. The abundance of BBAL southeast of Australia was observed to be decreased substantially whereas no significant change was observed in the abundance of LMSA. Both species demonstrated contrasting distributions along their latitudinal gradient with BBAL showing early stages of a southward range shift. Our analyses suggest that responses to climate change are species-specific. These rare, long-term data have provided an understanding of species’ responses to past changes in the marine environment and can provide critical information for future conservation and management.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Anthropogenic climate change is resulting in spatial redistributions of many species. We assessed the potential effects of climate change on an abundant and widely distributed group of diving birds, <jats:italic>Eudyptes<\/jats:italic> penguins, which are the main avian consumers in the Southern Ocean in terms of biomass consumption. Despite their abundance, several of these species have undergone population declines over the past century, potentially due to changing oceanography and prey availability over the important winter months. We used light‐based geolocation tracking data for 485 individuals deployed between 2006 and 2020 across 10 of the major breeding locations for five taxa of <jats:italic>Eudyptes<\/jats:italic> penguins. We used boosted regression tree modelling to quantify post‐moult habitat preference for southern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. chrysocome<\/jats:italic>), eastern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. filholi<\/jats:italic>), northern rockhopper (<jats:italic>E. moseleyi<\/jats:italic>) and macaroni/royal (<jats:italic>E. chrysolophus<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>E. schlegeli<\/jats:italic>) penguins. We then modelled their redistribution under two climate change scenarios, representative concentration pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (for the end of the century, 2071–2100). As climate forcings differ regionally, we quantified redistribution in the Atlantic, Central Indian, East Indian, West Pacific and East Pacific regions. We found sea surface temperature and sea surface height to be the most important predictors of current habitat for these penguins; physical features that are changing rapidly in the Southern Ocean. Our results indicated that the less severe RCP4.5 would lead to less habitat loss than the more severe RCP8.5. The five taxa of penguin may experience a general poleward redistribution of their preferred habitat, but with contrasting effects in the (i) change in total area of preferred habitat under climate change (ii) according to geographic region and (iii) the species (macaroni/royal vs. rockhopper populations). Our results provide further understanding on the regional impacts and vulnerability of species to climate change.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Mechanisms promoting coexistence between closely related species are fundamental for maintaining species diversity. Mechanisms of niche differentiation include allochrony which offsets the peak timing of resource utilisation between species. Many studies focus on spatial and temporal niche partitioning during the breeding season, few have investigated the role allochrony plays in influencing interspecific segregation of foraging distribution and ecology between congeneric species during the non-breeding season. We investigated the non-breeding migrations of Snares (<jats:italic>Eudyptes robustus<\/jats:italic>) and Fiordland penguins (<jats:italic>Eudyptes pachyrhynchus<\/jats:italic>), closely related species breeding between 100–350 km apart whose migration phenology differs by two months. Using light geolocation tracking, we examined the degree of overlap given the observed allochrony and a hypothetical scenario where the species commence migration simultaneously. We found that Fiordland penguins migrated to the Sub-Antarctic Frontal Zone and Polar Frontal Zone in the austral autumn whereas Snares penguins disperse westwards staying north of the Sub-Tropical Front in the austral winter. Our results suggest that allochrony is likely to be at the root of segregation because the relative profitability of the different water masses that the penguins forage in changes seasonally which results in the two species utilising different areas over their core non-breeding periods. Furthermore, allochrony reduces relatively higher levels of spatiotemporal overlap during the departure and arrival periods, when the close proximity of the two species’ colonies would cause the birds to congregate in similar areas, resulting in high interspecific competition just before the breeding season. Available evidence from other studies suggests that the shift in phenology between these species has arisen from adaptive radiation and phenological matching to the seasonality of local resource availability during the breeding season and reduced competitive overlap over the non-breeding season is likely to be an incidental outcome.<\/jats:p>",

We draw on advice identified during an online workshop (Ocean Plastic Workshop 2022) organized by Early Career Ocean Professionals (ECOPs) from 11 countries, held in April 2022. International experts and workshop participants discussed their experiences in the collaborative development and implementation of ocean plastic pollution projects held worldwide, guided by three main questions: (i) What is the role of scientists in a multi-stakeholder project? (ii) How should scientists communicate with other stakeholders? (iii) Which stakeholders are missing in collaborative projects, and why are they missing? This multidisciplinary, co-learning approach highlights the value of stakeholder engagement for ocean plastic projects with an end goal to identify and implement ocean plastic solutions via innovative technologies, informing policy, community engagement, or a combination of all three approaches. The target outcomes of the workshop described in this paper include the identification of transdisciplinary (academic-stakeholder) engagement frameworks and specific suggestions that can serve as guidelines for the development of future plastic pollution projects.<\/jats:p>",

However, not all polynyas form DSW. We examine how the physiographic setting, water‐mass distribution and transformation, water column stratification, and sea‐ice production regulate DSW formation in four East Antarctic coastal polynyas. We use a salt budget to estimate the relative contribution of sea‐ice production and lateral advection to the monthly change in salinity in each polynya. DSW forms in Mackenzie polynya due to a combination of physical features (shallow water depth and a broad continental shelf) and high sea‐ice production. Sea‐ice formation begins early (March) in Mackenzie polynya, counteracting fresh advection and establishing a salty mixed layer in autumn that preconditions the water column for deep convection in winter. Sea‐ice production is moderate in the other three polynyas, but saline DSW is not formed (a fresh variety is formed in the Barrier polynya). In the Shackleton polynya, brine rejection during winter is insufficient to overcome the very fresh autumn mixed layer. In Vincennes Bay, a strong inflow of modified Circumpolar Deep Water stratifies the water column, hindering deep convection and DSW formation. Our study highlights that DSW formation in a given polynya depends on a complex combination of factors, some of which may be strongly altered under a changing climate, with potentially important consequences for the ventilation of the deep ocean, the global meridional overturning circulation, and the transport of ocean heat to Antarctic ice shelves.<\/jats:p>",

Overwinter sea-ice presence and characteristics exert a strong control on larval survival and subsequent recruitment. Our understanding of the mechanisms through which sea ice influences survival are mainly underpinned by small-scale observations, whereas planktonic larvae may be advected over large scales. Using a state-of-the-art sea-ice model we computed Lagrangian back-trajectories to simulate larval krill advection into three distinct recruitment regions and examined modelled sea-ice habitat characteristics along trajectories. From these results we identify potential overwintering habitats and present a conceptual model for explaining regional variability in sea-ice habitat drivers of recruitment. Crucially, many of these sea-ice habitats are currently under-sampled. This work can inform future sampling efforts that will improve our understanding of climate change impacts, and potential interactions with the krill fishery.<\/jats:p>",

This high primary productivity, boosted by iron supply from coastal glaciers, attracts organisms from all trophic levels to form a rich and diverse community. How the ecological benefit of polynya productivity is translated to the highest trophic levels remains poorly resolved. We studied 119 southern elephant seals feeding over the Antarctic shelf and demonstrated that: (i) 96% of seals foraging here used polynyas, with individuals spending on average 62% of their time there; (ii) the seals exhibited more area-restricted search behaviour when in polynyas; and (iii) these seals gained more energy (indicated by increased buoyancy from greater fat stores) when inside polynyas. This higher-quality foraging existed even when ice was not present in the study area, indicating that these are important and predictable foraging grounds year-round. Despite these energetic advantages from using polynyas, not all the seals used them extensively. Factors other than food supply may influence an individual's choice in their use of feeding grounds, such as exposure to predation or the probability of being able to return to distant sub-Antarctic breeding sites.<\/jats:p>",

Dense Shelf Water (DSW) formation in MP shows large spatial variability that is related to the (a) local bathymetry, (b) water column preconditioning from the presence/absence of different water masses, and (c) proximity to the Amery Ice Shelf meltwater outflow. MP exhibits sustained sea ice production and brine rejection (thus, salinity increase) from April to October. However, new DSW is only formed from June onward, when the mixed layer deepens and convection is strong enough to break the stratification set by Antarctic Surface Water above and Ice Shelf Water below. We found no evidence of DSW export from MP to Darnley polynya, as previously suggested. Rather, our observations suggest some DSW formed in Darnley Polynya may drain toward the western Prydz Bay. Then, DSW is exported offshore from Prydz Bay through the Prydz Channel. The interplay between sea ice formation, meltwater input, and sea floor topography is likely to explain why some coastal polynyas form more DSW than others, as well as the temporal variability in DSW formation within a particular polynya.<\/jats:p>",

Toward understanding krill's response to environmental change, it is necessary to identify regions that support high krill larval production (spawning habitat). We develop a mechanistic model combining thermal and food requirements for krill egg production, with predation pressure post‐spawning, to predict regions of high‐quality spawning habitat. We optimize our model regionally and generate circumpolar predictions of spawning habitat quality. Our results indicate the southwest Atlantic accounts for almost half of all predicted high‐quality spawning habitat. Small‐scale management units (SSMUs) around the Antarctic Peninsula had high coverage of high‐quality spawning habitat. In contrast, the remaining SSMUs (except around South Georgia) were poorly covered, suggestive of population sinks reliant on input from external sources upstream. This implies strong potential for downstream impacts of fishing in key spawning areas, with implications for management of SSMUs and the krill fishery.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Biophysical interactions are influential in determining the scale of key ecological processes within marine ecosystems. For oceanic predators, this means foraging behaviour is influenced by processes shaping the distribution of prey. However, oceanic prey is difficult to observe and its abundance and distribution is regionally generalised. We use a spatiotemporally resolved simulation model to describe mid‐trophic prey distribution within the Southern Ocean and demonstrate insights that this modelled prey field provides into the foraging behaviour of a widely distributed marine predator, the southern elephant seal.<\/jats:p><jats:p>From a five‐year simulation of prey biomass, we computed climatologies of mean prey biomass (average prey conditions) and prey biomass variability (meso‐scale variability). We also compiled spatially gridded metrics of seal density and diving behaviour from 13 yr of tracking data. We statistically modelled these metrics as non‐linear functions of prey biomass (both mean and variability) and used these to predict seal distribution and behaviour. Our predictions were consistent with observations (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>adj<\/jats:sub> = 0.23), indicating that seals aggregate in regions of high mesoscale activity where eddies concentrate prey. Here, seals dived deeper (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.12, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.51) and spent less time hunting (R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>marg<\/jats:sub> = 0.05, R<jats:sup>2<\/jats:sup><jats:sub>cond<\/jats:sub> = 0.56), likely targeting deep but profitable prey patches. Seals generally avoided areas of low eddy activity where prey was likely dispersed. Most seals foraged south of the Subantarctic Front, despite north of the front exhibiting consistently high simulated prey biomasses. This likely reflects seal prey or habitat preferences, but also emphasises the importance of mesoscale prey biomass variability relative to regionally high mean biomass. This work demonstrates the value of coupling mechanistic representations of prey biomass with predator observations to provide insight into how biophysical processes combine to shape species distributions. This will be increasingly important for the robust prediction of species’ responses to rapid system change.<\/jats:p>",

Genetic and genomic studies have failed to detect any population structure for the species, suggesting a single panmictic population. However, the hyper‐abundance of krill slows the rate of genetic differentiation, masking potential underlying structure. Here we use high‐throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA genes to show that krill bacterial epibiont communities exhibit spatial structuring, driven mainly by distance rather than environmental factors, especially for strongly krill‐associated bacteria. Estimating the ecological processes driving bacterial community turnover indicated this was driven by bacterial dispersal limitation increasing with geographic distance. Furthermore, divergent epibiont communities generated from a single krill swarm split between aquarium tanks under near‐identical conditions suggests physical isolation in itself can cause krill‐associated bacterial communities to diverge. Our findings show that Antarctic krill‐associated bacterial communities are geographically structured, in direct contrast with the lack of structure observed for krill genetic and genomic data.<\/jats:p>",

New satellite tracks detail humpback whale migration pathways from Western Australia into the Southern Ocean. These highlight a focal feeding area during austral spring and early summer at the southern Kerguelen plateau, in a western boundary current where a sharp northward turn and retroflection of ocean fronts occurs along the eastern plateau edge. The topographic steering of oceanographic features here likely supports a predictable, productive and persistent forage ground. The spatial distribution of whaling catches and Discovery era mark-recaptures confirms the importance of this region to Western Australian humpback whales since at least historical times. Movement modelling discriminates sex-related behaviours, with females moving faster during both transit and resident periods, which may be a consequence of size or indicate differential energetic requirements. Relatively short and directed migratory pathways overall, together with high-quality, reliable forage resources may provide a partial explanation for the ongoing strong recovery demonstrated by this population. The combination of new oceanographic information and movement data provides enhanced understanding of important biological processes, which are relevant within the context of the current spatial management and conservation efforts in the Southern Ocean.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Foraging behaviour of marine predators inferred from the analysis of horizontal or vertical movements commonly lack quantitative information about foraging success. Several marine mammal species are known to perform dives where they passively drift in the water column, termed “drift” dives. The drift rate is determined by the animal’s buoyancy, which can be used to make inference regarding body condition. Long term dive records retrieved via satellite uplink are often summarized before transmission. This loss of resolution hampers identification of drift dives. Here, we develop a flexible, hierarchically structured approach to identify drift dives and estimate the drift rate from the summarized time-depth profiles that are increasingly available to the global research community. Based on high-resolution dive data from southern elephant seals, we classify dives as drift/non-drift and apply a summarization algorithm. We then (i) automatically generate dive groups based on inflection point ordering using a ‘Reverse’ Broken-Stick Algorithm, (ii) develop a set of threshold criteria to apply across groups, ensuring non-drift dives are most efficiently rejected, and (iii) finally implement a custom Kalman filter to retain the remaining dives that are within the seals estimated drifting time series. Validation with independent data sets shows our method retains approximately 3% of all dives, of which 88% are true drift dives. The drift rate estimates are unbiased, with the upper 95% quantile of the mean squared error between the daily averaged summarized profiles using our method (SDDR) and the observed daily averaged drift rate (ODDR) being only 0.0015. The trend of the drifting time-series match expectations for capital breeders, showing the lowest body condition commencing foraging trips and a progressive improvement as they remain at sea. Our method offers sufficient resolution to track small changes in body condition at a fine temporal scale. This approach overcomes a long-term challenge for large existing and ongoing data collections, with potential application across other drift diving species. Enabling robust identification of foraging success at sea offers a rare and valuable opportunity for monitoring marine ecosystem productivity in space and time by tracking the success of a top predator.<\/jats:p>",

Their spatio-temporal distribution is however, difficult to map across remote regions particularly the vast Southern Ocean. This represents a key gap in understanding biogeochemical processes, marine ecosystem structure, and how changing ocean conditions will affect marine predators, which depend upon mesopelagic prey. We infer mesopelagic prey vertical distribution and relative abundance in the Indian sector of the Southern Ocean (20° to 130°E) with a novel approach using predator-derived indices. Fourteen years of southern elephant seal tracking and dive data, from the open ocean between the Antarctic Polar Front and the southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current front, clearly show that the vertical distribution of mesopelagic prey is influenced by the physical hydrographic processes that structure their habitat. Mesopelagic prey have a more restricted vertical migration and higher relative abundance closer to the surface where Circumpolar Deep Water rises to shallower depths. Combining these observations with a future projection of Southern Ocean conditions we show that changes in the coupling of surface and deep waters will potentially redistribute mesopelagic prey. These changes are small overall, but show important spatial variability: prey will increase in relative abundance to the east of the Kerguelen Plateau but decrease to the west. The consequences for deep-diving specialists such as elephant seals and whales over this time scale will likely be minor, but the changes in mesoscale vertical energy flow have implications for predators that forage within the mesopelagic zone as well as the broader pelagic ecosystem.<\/jats:p>",

These seals migrate up to 4,000 km from their breeding colonies, foraging for months in a variety of Southern Ocean habitats. Understanding how movement patterns vary with environmental features and how these relationships differ among individuals employing different foraging strategies can provide insight into foraging performance at a population level. We apply new fast‐estimation tools to fit mixed effects within a random walk movement model, rapidly inferring among‐individual variability in southern elephant seal environment–movement relationships. We found that seals making foraging trips to the sea ice on or near the Antarctic continental shelf consistently reduced speed and directionality (move persistence) with increasing sea‐ice coverage but had variable responses to chlorophyll <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic> concentration, whereas seals foraging in the open ocean reduced move persistence in regions where circumpolar deep water shoaled. Given future climate scenarios, open‐ocean foragers may encounter more productive habitat but sea‐ice foragers may see reduced habitat availability. Our approach is scalable to large telemetry data sets and allows flexible combinations of mixed effects to be evaluated via model selection, thereby illuminating the ecological context of animal movements that underlie habitat usage.<\/jats:p>",

Surprisingly, of the oceanic blooms, those associated with the deeper southern plateau last much longer (~3 months) than the northern bloom (~1‐month downstream of northern plateau). In this study, iron supply mechanisms around the southern plateau were investigated, obtaining profiles of dissolved iron (&lt;0.2 μm, dFe) to 2,000‐m deep at 25 stations during austral summer 2016. The dFe concentrations in surface waters (≤100‐m depth) ranged from below the detection limit (DL, median of 0.026 nmol/kg) to 0.34 nmol/kg near the Antarctic shelf, with almost half the data points below detection. These low and—with few exceptions—largely spatially invariant concentrations, presumably driven by seasonal drawdown of this essential micronutrient by phytoplankton, could not explain observed patterns in chlorophyll <jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic>. In contrast, dFe concentrations (0.05–1.27 nmol/kg) in subsurface waters (100–800 m) showed strong spatial variations that can explain bloom patterns around the southern Kerguelen plateau when considered in the context of frontal locations and associated frontal processes, including upwelling, that may increase the upward supply of dFe in the region. This sustained vertical dFe supply distinguishes the southern blooms from the bloom downstream of the northern Kerguelen plateau and explains their persistence through the season.<\/jats:p>",

These seals migrate up to 4000 km from their breeding colonies, foraging for months in a variety of Southern Ocean habitats. Understanding how movement patterns vary with environmental features and how these relationships differ among individuals employing different foraging strategies can provide insight into foraging performance at a population level. We apply new fast-estimation tools to fit mixed effects within a random walk movement model, rapidly inferring among-individual variability in southern elephant seal environment-movement relationships. We found that seals making foraging trips to the sea-ice on or near the Antarctic continental shelf consistently reduced speed and directionality (move persistence) with increasing sea ice coverage and had variable responses to chlorophyll<jats:italic>a<\/jats:italic>concentration, whereas seals that foraged pelagically reduced move persistence in regions where circumpolar deep water shoaled. Given future climate scenarios, pelagic foragers may encounter more productive habitat but sea-ice foragers may see reduced habitat availability. Our approach is scalable to large telemetry data sets and allows flexible combinations of mixed effects to be evaluated via model selection, thereby illuminating the ecological context of animal movements that underlie habitat use.<\/jats:p>",

However, with advances in satellite tagging technology and concurrent development of analytical methodologies we can now detail finer scale humpback whale movement, infer behavioural context and examine how these animals interact with their physical environment. Here we describe the temporal and spatial characteristics of migration along the east Australian seaboard and into the Southern Ocean by 30 humpback whales satellite tagged over three consecutive austral summers. We characterise the putative Antarctic feeding grounds and identify supplemental foraging within temperate, migratory corridors. We demonstrate that Antarctic foraging habitat is associated with the marginal ice zone, with key predictors of inferred foraging behaviour including distance from the ice edge, ice melt rate and variability in ice concentration two months prior to arrival. We discuss the highly variable ice season within the putative foraging habitat and the implications that this and other environmental factors may have on the continued strong recovery of this humpback whale population.<\/jats:p>",

This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill <jats:italic>Euphausia superba<\/jats:italic>, using acoustic observations of individual swarms (aggregations) from a large‐scale survey off East Antarctica. We developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope, but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter models to generate regional‐scale spatial predictions using a 10‐yr remotely‐sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were consistently predicted during austral mid‐summers, which may underpin key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies, illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to other krill‐dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern Ocean and beyond.<\/jats:p>",

We use species habitat models to predict the winter foraging habitats of female southern elephant seals and investigate how changes in environmental variables within these habitats may be related to observed decreases in the Macquarie Island population. There were three main groups of seals that specialized in different ocean realms (the sub‐Antarctic, the Ross Sea and the Victoria Land Coast). The physical and climate attributes (e.g. wind strength, sea surface height, ocean current strength) varied amongst the realms and also displayed different temporal trends over the last two to four decades. Most notably, sea ice extent increased on average in the Victoria Land realm while it decreased overall in the Ross Sea realm. Using a species distribution model relating mean residence times (time spent in each 50 × 50 km grid cell) to 9 climate and physical co‐variates, we developed spatial predictions of residence time to identify the core regions used by the seals across the Southern Ocean from 120°E to 120°W. Population size at Macquarie Island was negatively correlated with ice concentration within the core habitat of seals using the Victoria Land Coast and the Ross Sea. Sea ice extent and concentration is predicted to continue to change in the Southern Ocean, having unknown consequences for the biota of the region. The proportion of Macquarie Island females (40%) utilizing the relatively stable sub‐Antarctic region, may buffer this population against longer‐term regional changes in habitat quality, but the Macquarie Island population has persistently decreased (−1.45% per annum) over seven decades indicating that environmental changes in the Antarctic are acting on the remaining 60% of the population to impose a long‐term population decline in a top Southern Ocean predator.<\/jats:p>",

Large telemetry and tracking data sets have been collected for this group of animals, and are accompanied by many empirical studies that seek to segment tracks in some useful way, as well as theoretical studies of optimal foraging strategies. However, relatively few studies have detailed statistical methods for inferring behaviors in central place foraging trips. In this paper we describe an approach based on hidden Markov models, which splits foraging trips into segments labeled as “outbound”, “search”, “forage”, and “inbound”. By structuring the hidden Markov model transition matrix appropriately, the model naturally handles the sequence of behaviors within a foraging trip. Additionally, by structuring the model in this way, we are able to develop realistic simulations from the fitted model. We demonstrate our approach on data from southern elephant seals (<jats:italic>Mirounga leonina<\/jats:italic>) tagged on Kerguelen Island in the Southern Ocean. We discuss the differences between our 4‐state model and the widely used 2‐state model, and the advantages and disadvantages of employing a more complex model.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>Animal movement research relies on biotelemetry, and telemetry‐based locations are increasingly augmented with ancillary information. This presents an underutilized opportunity to enhance movement process models. Given tags designed to record specific behaviors, efforts are increasing to update movement models beyond reliance solely upon horizontal movement information to improve inference of space use and activity budgets. We present two state‐space models adapted to incorporate ancillary data to inform three discrete movement states: directed, resident, and an activity state. These were developed for two case studies: (1) a “haulout” model for Weddell seals, and (2) an “activity” model for Antarctic fur seals which intersperse periods of diving activity and inactivity. The methodology is easily implementable with any ancillary data that can be expressed as a proportion (or binary) indicator. A comparison of the models augmented with ancillary information and unaugmented models confirmed that many behavioral states appeared mischaracterized in the latter. Important changes in subsequent activity budgets occurred. Haulout accounted for 0.17 of the overall Weddell seal time budget, with the estimated proportion of time spent in a resident state reduced from a posterior median of 0.69 (0.65–0.73; 95% <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>) to 0.54 (0.50–0.58 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>). The drop was more dramatic in the Antarctic fur seal case, from 0.57 (0.52–0.63 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>) to 0.22 (0.20–0.25 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>), with 0.35 (0.31–0.39 <jats:styled-content style=\"fixed-case\">HPDI<\/jats:styled-content>) of time spent in the inactive (nondiving) state. These findings reinforce previously raised contentions about the drawbacks of behavioral states inferred solely from horizontal movements. Our findings have implications for assessing habitat requirements; estimating energetics and consumption; and management efforts such as mitigating fisheries interactions. Combining multiple sources of information within integrated frameworks should improve inference of relationships between movement decisions and fitness, the interplay between resource and habitat dependencies, and their changes at the population and landscape level.<\/jats:p>",

Alternative theoretical models and inconsistent empirical findings mean that this question remains unresolved. Here we tested expectations by incorporating the vertical dimension (dive information) when predicting switching between movement states (“resident” or “directed”) within a state‐space model. We integrated telemetry‐based tracking and diving data available for four seal species (southern elephant, Weddell, antarctic fur, and crabeater) in East Antarctica. Where possible, we included dive variables derived from the relationships between (1) dive duration and depth (as a measure of effort), and (2) dive duration and the postdive surface interval (as a physiological measure of cost). Our results varied within and across species, but there was a general tendency for the probability of switching into “resident” state to be positively associated with shorter dive durations (for a given depth) and longer postdive surface intervals (for a given dive duration). Our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting that simplistic interpretations of optimal foraging theory based only on horizontal movements do not directly translate into the vertical dimension in dynamic marine environments. Analyses that incorporate at least two dimensions can test more sophisticated models of foraging behavior.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Foraging theory predicts that mobile predators should target high profitability areas with plentiful resources and minimize time spent moving between these areas. This has led to a focus in recent literature on the identification of “hotspots” important for migratory marine predators, i.e., regions where predators spend disproportionate amounts of time ostensibly due to high prey abundance; and determination of the environmental features characteristic of such areas. We investigated factors predicting foraging success in southern bluefin tuna (SBT; <jats:named-content content-type=\"genus-species\">Thunnus maccoyii<\/jats:named-content>), by integrating telemetry‐based feeding and movement data (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic> = 19 fish, length to caudal fork [LCF] = 99 ± 3 cm) with environmental data over the scale of their annual oceanic migrations during 1998–2000. We used widely available statistical modeling techniques, generalized linear models, and generalized linear mixed models, formulated to represent feeding as a Markov process. The results showed increased feeding and predictability of feeding occurs in the coastal waters of southern Australia, providing some evidence that this area represents a fixed foraging “hotspot” for juvenile tuna during the austral summer. However, in oceanic waters southern bluefin tuna did not fit the common model of migration, but rather showed a pattern of relatively high foraging success throughout their migratory range, especially during periods of continuous travel. Interestingly, foraging “coldspots” (prolonged low‐feeding periods) as well as “hotspots” were apparent across individual tracks, predicted most strongly by warm ocean temperatures. These results provide a new perspective on the ecology of large‐scale feeding migrations within the context of the heterogeneous ocean environment, where the continuous and opportunistic feeding of generalist predators may be more common, particularly in predatory large pelagic fishes, than is currently documented.<\/jats:p>",

In this paper we use archival tag data from juvenile southern bluefin tuna (<jats:italic>Thunnus maccoyii<\/jats:italic>, SBT) to (i) develop a novel approach characterising the oceanographic habitats used throughout an annual migration cycle on the basis of water column structure (i.e., temperature‐at‐depth data from tags), and (ii) model how the vertical behaviour of SBT altered in relation to habitat type and other factors. Using this approach, we identified eight habitat types occupied by juvenile SBT between the southern margin of the subtropical gyre and the northern edge of the Subantarctic Front in the south Indian Ocean. Although a high degree of variability was evident both within and between fish, mixed‐effect models identified consistent behavioural responses to habitat, lunar phase, migration status and diel period. Our results indicate SBT do not act to maintain preferred depth or temperature ranges, but rather show highly plastic behaviours in response to changes in their environment. This plasticity is discussed in terms of the potential proximate causes (physiological, ecological) and with reference to the challenges posed for habitat‐based standardisation of fishery data used in stock assessments.<\/jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Breeding Adélie penguins forage at sea and return to land to provision their chicks, adjusting their foraging behaviour in response to environmental fluctuations over time. At Béchervaise Island, a nesting site in an East Antarctic population, Adélie penguin diving behaviour remains undocumented. This represents a key area of uncertainty in efforts to understand and predict foraging success at this colony. We compiled a multi-year telemetry dataset from time-depth recorders deployed from 1992 to 2004 on 64 birds at Béchervaise Island. We examined diving activity at multiple scales, ranging from foraging trips (n = 125) to dive bouts (n = 3461) to individual dives (n = 84521), and then characterised the stage- and sex-specific variation in diving behaviour of chick-rearing Adélie penguins using linear mixed effect models. Total foraging trip effort (trip duration, number of dives, vertical distance travelled and number of wiggles [a proxy for prey ingestion]) substantially increased as the chick-rearing period progressed (guard through crèche), consistent with increasing chick provisioning and self-maintenance requirements over time. Foraging activity was predominantly structured in periods of sustained diving bouts, indicating sustained foraging effort over the course of the foraging trip. Diving behaviour (dive-level depth, duration, bottom time and attempts of catch per unit effort) varied in relation to sex and chick-rearing stage. Dives were performed more frequently during high and low levels of solar light, which is likely linked to visual predation strategies or prey activity. Our findings advance our understanding of this population’s foraging behaviour, which is ultimately required to underpin the conservation and management of this breeding colony.<\/jats:p>",
