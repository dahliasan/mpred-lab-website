    (~6 %) these living resources provide almost 40% of estimated global ''services''

  whatDoesYourProjectInvolve?:
    I have spent many hours in the field collecting fish
    from Tasmania to an island off Cape York. Whilst being in the field is challenging
    and thrilling, back in the lab I get down to the dirty work - sorting through
    fish gut contents and dealing with hundreds of fish tissue biopsies. This side
    of things involves a tough stomach (ironically) to tolerate the strongly unpleasant
    smalls, a lot of staring down microscropes, and eventually hours on computer programs,
    writing code, performing complex statistics, and summarising my work into a written
    synthesis to share with the world.

    <p id="">My project fits in the interface
    between Southern Ocean predators and their prey. I work with models that simulate
    the distribution and dynamics of mid-trophic organisms, show how these can be
    linked with predator variables such as distribution, behaviour as well as demographic
    parameters. At the same time, I am also involved in adapting prey models to represent

    Australian fur seals breed annually from late October
    to late December. Typically, they have bred in the Bass Strait, however, recently
    a breeding colony has established in Southwest Tasmania at the southern edge of

  researchInFiveWords: DNA metabarcoding, poo, food webs
  giveAnOutlineOfYourProjectAndCurrentResearch:
    <p id="">Understanding the diet of
    top order consumers is fundamental for assessing ecosystem dynamics, structure,
    and stability. Typically, there is a lag between the effects of environmental
    variation on lower trophic levels, and the ultimate effects on marine predators.
    Due to this, studying marine mammal and seabird diets can act as a mechanism for
    assessing the impact of environmental change on marine systems, and potentially
    forecasting future ecosystem states. Using DNA metabarcoding, we can obtain high-resolution
    dietary data from land-based marine predators non-invasively. For my PhD I will
    be developing a comprehensive framework for incorporating DNA dietary data into
    food web networks and models, with the aim of producing a marine ecosystem monitoring

  researchInFiveWords: Stool tool for any fool
  giveAnOutlineOfYourProjectAndCurrentResearch:
    <p id="">A key component of ecosystem
    monitoring programs that aim to support the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem
    function is sound knowledge of species composition and food web linkages. This
    information provides a foundation for assessing ecosystem changes and can allow
    causal links to be clarified (e.g. interactions between marine predators and fishery
    resources). Seals and seabirds are responsive and reflective of changes in the
    availability of lower trophic levels, which makes these predators ideal indicator
    species for changes in marine ecosystems. Dietary studies provide a mechanism
    to assess environmental and fisheries-related changes in marine systems, as well
    as the marine biodiversity of a region. DNA metabarcoding of predator scats is
    a non-invasive tool which allows the diet of a range of predator species to be
    investigated simultaneously, increasing our understanding of ecosystem connectivity
    and food web structure.</p>
  whatDoesYourProjectInvolve?:
    During this fellowship I will work with a team to develop
    a marine ecosystem monitoring framework using top predator scat DNA to assess
    species biodiversity in the Subantarctic. By simultaneously studying the diet
    of a range of predators, we will resolve food web linkages and investigate the
    use of quantitative models integrating DNA sequence datasets. Through the collation
    of existing dietary data and new robust dietary information, we will provide a
    sound foundation for future monitoring programs to assess changes in species diversity
    and identify species that may be at risk from fishery engagement.
  whatAreYouBroaderResearchInterests?:
    I have a particular love of the Subantarctic,

  researchInFiveWords: Eradicate rabbits, some skuas die
  giveAnOutlineOfYourProjectAndCurrentResearch:
    "<p id=\"\">I\u2019m studying how\
    \ the eradication of invasive rabbits from subantarctic Macquarie Island affected\
    \ the diet and breeding of a native predator, the Brown Skua.</p>"
  whatDoesYourProjectInvolve?:
    My work includes nest monitoring, GPS tracking, stable
    isotope analysis (including compound-specific stable isotope analysis), and the
    use of a diverse suite of modelling techniques to investigate longitudinal datasets
    and the bottom-up effects of eradication.

    \ for conservation management, with a focus on top-order predators and their prey.Although,\
    \ I\u2019m also interested in many aspects of ecology and natural history including:\
    \ behavioural ecology, geology, desert ecology, megafauna extinction, marsupial\
    \ ecology, birds of tropical south-east Asia and scientific illustration."

    Prior to my current research,
    I completed an Honours degree at the University of Tasmania studying the predator-awareness
    of long-nosed potoroos on Maria Island following the introduction of a novel predator,
    Tasmanian Devils. I have also worked as a geologist, and with the Tasmanian State
    Government on fur-seal surveys, shearwater surveys, deploying GPS loggers on Shy
    Albatross and installing artificial nests in Shy Albatross colonies.

  researchInFiveWords: Killer whales are costly competitors
  giveAnOutlineOfYourProjectAndCurrentResearch: "My current research is on killer whale depredation in the blue-eye trevalla commercial longline fisheries of south-east Australia. In simple terms, depredation can be defined as the complete or partial removal of caught fish from fishing gears by marine predators. During my master's thesis, I had estimated the amount of blue-eye trevalla taken by killer whales in the same fisheries. My current work involves the use of DSLR cameras to collect pictures of depredating killer whales for future photo identification studies, deploying underwater acoustic hydrophones to collect their vocalisations and to collect fishing data from a commercial fishing vessel (Fishing Vessel: Diana, Mures Fishing, Hobart)."
  whatDoesYourProjectInvolve?: ''
  whatAreYouBroaderResearchInterests?:
    My research interests include studying the
    behavioural ecology of higher-order and apex predators from the Southern Ocean.
    Since most of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic islands are in remote locations,
    the mysteries surrounding the foraging strategies, spatial behaviour and phenology
    of marine predators makes me want to study them even more.
