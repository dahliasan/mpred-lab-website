    '<p id="">Reef and coastal fisheries possess an extraordinary amount of living
    things (like fish, crabs, corals and algae) condensed into a small space, with
    its nearest rivals only being rainforests and agriculture. </p><p id="">Despite
    being such a small part of the global surface (~6 %) these living resources provide
    almost 40% of estimated global ''services'' provided by the natural world. According
    to the world bank, ~ 3 billion people rely on coastal and marine fisheries, which
    indirectly or directly employ ~ 200 million people. </p><p id="">Meanwhile 680
    million people live in coastal regions, a number expected to grow to a billion
    by 2050. Unlocking the natural processes which structure coastal ecosystems can
    help us understand how these systems may change and respond to pressures such
    as fisheries and climate change, and can also help us understand the intricacy
    and maintain the integrity of these complex systems. </p><p id="">Although my
    work only plays a small part in the bigger picture, I am proud to investigate
    the little piece of the puzzle which traces how energy in the form of sunlight
    enters these systems and is transferred to predators such as the fish which may
    feed or provide work for billions of mankind.</p><p id="">Featured article: <a

    fish from Tasmania to an island off Cape York. Whilst being in the field is challenging
    and thrilling, back in the lab I get down to the dirty work - sorting through
    fish gut contents and dealing with hundreds of fish tissue biopsies. This side
    of things involves a tough stomach (ironically) to tolerate the strongly unpleasant
    smalls, a lot of staring down microscropes, and eventually hours on computer programs,

    of marine habitats. Connecting all the world's oceans, the physical structure
    of the Southern Ocean influences world climate and ecology, and plays a key role
    in global climate. </p><p id="">Within the IMOS program we use satellite linked
    data loggers that measure physical ocean properties (specifically salinity, temperature,
    and depth) to depths of up to 2000m. Merging oceanography with marine mammal ecology
    advances our understanding of the world's oceans and its top predators, and allows

  researchProjectIn5Words: DNA metabarcoding, poo, food webs
  bio:
    <p id="">Understanding the diet of top order consumers is fundamental for assessing
    ecosystem dynamics, structure, and stability. Typically, there is a lag between
    the effects of environmental variation on lower trophic levels, and the ultimate
    effects on marine predators. Due to this, studying marine mammal and seabird diets
    can act as a mechanism for assessing the impact of environmental change on marine
    systems, and potentially forecasting future ecosystem states. Using DNA metabarcoding,
    we can obtain high-resolution dietary data from land-based marine predators non-invasively.
    For my PhD I will be developing a comprehensive framework for incorporating DNA
    dietary data into food web networks and models, with the aim of producing a marine
    ecosystem monitoring tool for sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island.</p> <p>My project
    involves extracting DNA from marine predator poo to work out what they are eating
    and then integrating that data into food web networks. </p> <p>My key research
    interests involve marine predators, ecology, genetics and modelling. </p>

  bio:
    "<p id=\"\">Ad\xE9lie penguins as ecosystem indicators: foraging behaviour\
    \ and habitat. Through this research project, we expect to further understand\
    \ the movement behaviour and foraging strategies of Ad\xE9lie penguins, and their\

    \ <p>My PhD project involves analysing long-term satellite telemetry and dive\

    \ CEMP site monitored since 1990) to focus on thespecific interactions between\
    \ Ad\xE9lie penguin foraging movements and their marine and sea-ice environment.</p>\
    \ <p>Broadly speaking, I am passionate about pursuing research which furthers\
    \ our understanding of Southern Ocean predator-prey relationships, and how these\

  researchProjectIn5Words: Stool tool for any fool
  bio:
    <p id="">A key component of ecosystem monitoring programs that aim to support
    the maintenance of biodiversity and ecosystem function is sound knowledge of species
    composition and food web linkages. This information provides a foundation for
    assessing ecosystem changes and can allow causal links to be clarified (e.g. interactions
    between marine predators and fishery resources). Seals and seabirds are responsive
    and reflective of changes in the availability of lower trophic levels, which makes
    these predators ideal indicator species for changes in marine ecosystems. Dietary
    studies provide a mechanism to assess environmental and fisheries-related changes
    in marine systems, as well as the marine biodiversity of a region. DNA metabarcoding
    of predator scats is a non-invasive tool which allows the diet of a range of predator
    species to be investigated simultaneously, increasing our understanding of ecosystem
    connectivity and food web structure.</p> <p>During this fellowship I will work
    with a team to develop a marine ecosystem monitoring framework using top predator
    scat DNA to assess species biodiversity in the Subantarctic. By simultaneously
    studying the diet of a range of predators, we will resolve food web linkages and
    investigate the use of quantitative models integrating DNA sequence datasets.
    Through the collation of existing dietary data and new robust dietary information,
    we will provide a sound foundation for future monitoring programs to assess changes
    in species diversity and identify species that may be at risk from fishery engagement.</p>
    <p>I have a particular love of the Subantarctic, with a focus on applied research
    leading to conservation and management outcomes for seabirds and marine mammals.</p>

  researchProjectIn5Words: Impacts of plastics on seabirds
  bio:
    "<p id=\"\">I am very fortunate to be able to work on the remote sub-tropical,\
    \ Lord Howe Island. My fieldwork is emotionally challenging, as I extract plastic\
    \ from Flesh-footed Shearwater chicks. My lab work consists of molecular and histopathology\
    \ analysis of shearwaters and their stomachs to determine if plastics have caused\
    \ any detectable harm.</p> <p>I use a variety of lab techniques to understand\
    \ what plastics and their associated chemicals do to the physiology and health\
    \ of seabirds.</p> <p>With a background in archaeology, I am interested in the\
    \ things people leave behind, our past and future fossils. My research interests\
    \ explores these \u2018fossils\u2019 such as plastics. I ground my research in\
    \ conservation physiology, understanding how an animal\u2019s body functions to\
    \ better understand these anthropogenic impacts.</p>"

  researchProjectIn5Words: Modelling Southern Elephant Seal Demography
  bio:
    <p id="">Modelling climate influences on Southern Elephant Seal Demography
    </p> <p>With capture histories dating back to the 1960s, Macquarie Island holds
    one of the most continuously studied elephant seal populations. I will be developing
    demographic models to analyse the survival of southern elephant seals (Mirounga
    leonina). The Macquarie Island population has been shown to be in continuous decline,
    while other populations are stable or increasing. We hope to explain some of this
    decline by incorporating environmental variables (eg Southern Annular Mode; sea-ice
    extent, etc.) into our models to see if changes in ecosystem structure may be
    influencing demographic parameters.</p> <p>Marine ecology, modelling, biostatistics,

  bio:
    "<p id=\"\">I\u2019m a Senior Lecturer in Quantitative Southern Ocean Ecology\
    \ within the Ecology &amp; Biodiversity Centre at IMAS-UTAS. I have a passion\

    \ ecology, habitat dependencies and how animals\u2019 use areas; behavioural ecology;\
    \ environmental and climate influences on marine predator ecology; prey distribution\
    \ and oceanic predator-prey interactions. I also work collaboratively across trophic\
    \ levels to provide a holistic perspective on a diversity of Antarctic ecosystem\
    \ components, including ocean dynamics, iron supply, phytoplankton, sea-ice algae,\
    \ and parasites, through salps, krill, fish, and squid. Studying mammals and seabirds\
    \ of high conservation value I have a strong interest in improving predictive\
    \ capacity for future scenarios and developing ecological indicators relevant\
    \ for ecosystem monitoring.</p><p id=\"\">Marine systems are naturally complex,\

  researchProjectIn5Words: Killer whales are costly competitors
  bio:
    "<p id=\"\">My current research is on killer whale depredation in the blue-eye\
    \ trevalla commercial longline fisheries of south-east Australia. In simple terms,\
    \ depredation can be defined as the complete or partial removal of caught fish\
    \ from fishing gears by marine predators. During my master\u2019s thesis, I had\
    \ estimated the amount of blue-eye trevalla taken by killer whales in the same\
    \ fisheries.</p> <p>My current work involves the use of DSLR cameras to collect\
    \ pictures of depredating killer whales for future photo identification studies,\
    \ deploying underwater acoustic hydrophones to collect their vocalisations and\
    \ to collect fishing data from a commercial fishing vessel (Fishing Vessel: Diana,\
    \ Mures Fishing, Hobart).</p> <p>My research interests include studying the behavioural\
    \ ecology of higher-order and apex predators from the Southern Ocean. Since most\
    \ of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic islands are in remote locations, the mysteries\
    \ surrounding the foraging strategies, spatial behaviour and phenology of marine\
    \ predators makes me want to study them even more.</p>"
